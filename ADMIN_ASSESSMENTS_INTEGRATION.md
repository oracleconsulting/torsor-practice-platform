# Admin Portal - Team Assessments Integration

## Overview
The `TeamAssessmentDashboard` component was already built with comprehensive VARK and OCEAN assessment data visualization, but it wasn't accessible from the admin portal. This update integrates it properly so administrators can view and analyze team personality profiles and learning styles.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Problem
- ❌ `TeamAssessmentDashboard.tsx` component existed but had no route
- ❌ No way for admins to access team assessment data

### Solution
- ✅ Added route: `/team/assessments` → `TeamAssessmentDashboard`
- ✅ Imported component in main routes file
- ✅ Added prominent navigation card in `AdminDashboardPage`
- ✅ Beautiful purple gradient design for visibility
- ✅ Clear call-to-action button
