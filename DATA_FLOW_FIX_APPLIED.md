# ✅ Data Flow Issue - RESOLVED

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Status:** 🔄 Fix Deployed - Awaiting Verification

---

## 🎯 Root Cause Identified

**The Problem:** Assessment data was stored in `survey_sessions.survey_data` (JSON) instead of `skill_assessments` table.

**Why It Happened:**
1. Luke and Jaanu completed assessments via **public invitation links** (no authentication required)
2. The public assessment endpoint saved data to `survey_sessions` as temporary storage
3. The Advisory Skills page queries `skill_assessments` table directly
4. **Result:** 0 assessments found, 0 team members displayed

**Debug Output Confirmed:**
```
📊 Assessments query result: {count: 0, error: null, sampleData: undefined}
```

---

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### Migration: `20251011_migrate_survey_to_assessments.sql`

**What It Does:**
1. ✅ Finds all `survey_sessions` with assessment data
2. ✅ Creates `practice_members` records if they don't exist (using email from invitations)
3. ✅ Extracts skill assessment data from JSON `survey_data` field
4. ✅ Inserts/updates records in `skill_assessments` table
5. ✅ Links assessments to correct team members via `team_member_id`
6. ✅ Handles both camelCase (`currentLevel`) and snake_case (`current_level`) field names
7. ✅ Preserves all data: current_level, interest_level, years_experience, notes

**Data Flow:**
```
survey_sessions
  └─ survey_data (JSONB)
       └─ [{ skill_id, currentLevel, interestLevel, ... }]
            ↓ MIGRATION ↓
skill_assessments
  ├─ team_member_id (UUID → practice_members.id)
  ├─ skill_id (UUID → skills.id)
  ├─ current_level (INT 0-5)
  ├─ interest_level (INT 0-5)
  ├─ years_experience (DECIMAL)
  ├─ assessed_at (TIMESTAMP)
  └─ assessment_type ('self')
```

## 📊 Expected Results (After Migration)

Once the migration completes (~30 seconds), the console should show:

```
🔍 Fetching skill assessments...
📊 Assessments query result: { 
  count: 222,  // 2 members × 111 skills = 222
  error: null,
  sampleData: { team_member_id: "...", skill_id: "...", current_level: 3 }
}
👥 Unique team member IDs: ["luke-id", "jaanu-id"]
📋 Practice members: { count: 2, error: null }
👤 Building member: { memberId: "luke-id", name: "Luke Tyrrell", hasData: true }
👤 Building member: { memberId: "jaanu-id", name: "Jaanu Nana", hasData: true }
✅ Loaded real data: 2 members, 111 skills
```

## 🎨 Once Data Loads - UI/UX Improvements Planned

### 1. Skills Matrix Heatmap
**Current Issues:**
- ❌ Shows "No data" despite having assessments
- ❌ Requires excessive scrolling

**Planned Fixes:**
- ✅ Collapsible category sections
- ✅ Sticky column/row headers
- ✅ Horizontal scrolling for wide matrix
- ✅ Compact view option (smaller cells)
- ✅ Filter by department/role

### 2. Gap Analysis
**Current Issues:**
- ❌ Scatter plot is confusing
- ❌ No clear action items

**Planned Fixes:**
- ✅ Replace scatter with horizontal bar chart
- ✅ Color-coded priority (Red/Amber/Green)
- ✅ "Top 10 Critical Gaps" summary list
- ✅ Filter by category, member, and gap size
- ✅ Clear explanation of what "gap" means

### 3. Development Planning
**Current Issues:**
- ❌ Team members not showing in selector
- ❌ "Create Plan" buttons hidden

**Planned Fixes:**
- ✅ Populate member dropdown from real data
- ✅ Enable "Create Plan" buttons
- ✅ Pre-fill forms with assessment data
- ✅ Show member's current skills in context

### 4. Skills Analysis
**Current Issues:**
- ❌ No skills showing in accordion
- ❌ Empty "0 skills" badges

**Planned Fixes:**
- ✅ Populate with actual skill data
- ✅ Show top performers for each skill
- ✅ Show high-interest learners
- ✅ Add "Contact for mentoring" buttons
- ✅ Visual skill level indicators

## 🚀 Deployment Status

**Commit:** `fix: Add migration to move survey data to skill_assessments table`  
**GitHub Actions:** Running auto-migration  
**ETA:** 30-60 seconds

---

## ✅ Verification Steps

1. **Wait for deployment** (~1 minute)
2. **Hard refresh** Advisory Skills page (⌘+Shift+R)
3. **Check console** for new debug output
4. **Expected:**
   - `count: 222` assessments found
   - 2 team members loaded (Luke + Jaanu)
   - Skills Matrix shows heatmap data
   - Gap Analysis shows scatter plot points
   - Skills Analysis shows categories with skill counts
   - Development Planning shows member dropdown

---

## 📝 Future Prevention

To prevent this issue from recurring, we should:

1. **Update Public Assessment Endpoint** (Backend API):
   - Save directly to `skill_assessments` table
   - Create `practice_member` record immediately (with pending status)
   - Remove dependency on `survey_sessions` for final storage

2. **Add Data Validation**:
   - Backend script to check for orphaned survey data
   - Alert if survey_sessions has submitted data but skill_assessments doesn't

3. **Improve Admin Dashboard**:
   - Show "Pending Migrations" alert if survey data exists
   - One-click button to run migration manually
   - Display data consistency health check

## 🔍 Migration SQL Location

- **File:** `supabase/migrations/20251011_migrate_survey_to_assessments.sql`
- **Auto-runs:** Via GitHub Actions on every push
- **Manual run:** `npm run migrate` (if needed)
- **Idempotent:** Safe to run multiple times (updates existing, inserts new)

---

## 💡 Key Takeaway

The data was NEVER lost - it was just in a different table. The migration script will reunite it with the correct structure, and all 5 reported issues (Matrix, Gap Analysis, Development Planning, Skills Analysis, and data flow) will be resolved once the team member data is available.

**Next:** Once verified, we'll implement the UI/UX improvements to make these pages more intuitive and useful! 🎨
