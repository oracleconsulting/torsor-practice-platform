# Strategic Team Planning Features - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Today (October 20, 2025)

### 1. **Fixed CPD Recommendations** ✅
**Problem**: Generic "Formal Training Program" recommendations weren't helpful.

**Solution**: Context-aware, skill-specific CPD suggestions
- Recommendations now show: `[Skill Name] - [Specific CPD Type]`
- Examples:
  - `Xero Advanced Features - Online Tutorial`
  - `Tax Planning Strategies - Professional Workshop`
  - `Client Advisory - Shadowing & Mentoring`

**Logic by Category**:
- **Technical/Software** → Online Tutorials, Hands-on Workshops
- **Tax/Compliance** → CPD Webinars, Accredited Training Programs
- **Advisory/Consulting** → Shadowing & Mentoring, Case Study Workshops
- **Communication/Soft Skills** → Interactive Workshops, Development Programs
- **Management/Reporting** → Practical Workshops, Applied Training Courses

### 2. **Service Line Interest Rankings System** ✅
**Database Schema Created**: `service_line_interests` table
- Practice member preferences for 8 BSG service lines
- Interest ranking (1 = most interested)
- Current experience level (0-5)
- Desired involvement percentage (0-100%)
- Notes field for context

**BSG Service Lines**:
1. Automation
2. Management Accounts
3. Advisory/Forecasting
4. 365 Alignment
5. Systems Audit
6. Client Vault
7. Compliance
8. Core Capability

**Strategic View Created**: `service_line_coverage`
- Combines:
  * Member interest rankings
  * Current experience levels
  * Assessed skill levels in that service line
- Calculates **match_score** for deployment planning
- Enables optimal team-to-service-line matching

**API Functions Created** (`service-line-interests.ts`):
```typescript
getServiceLineInterests(memberId)        // Get member's rankings
saveServiceLineInterests(memberId, interests)  // Update preferences
getServiceLineCoverage(practiceId)       // Strategic view
getTeamForServiceLine(serviceLine)       // Find best team members
getServiceLineInterestSummary(practiceId) // Practice-wide analysis
```

## 🚧 To Be Built (Tomorrow's Priority)

### 1. **Service Line Interest UI Component** 🔨
**Where**: Team member portal
**Component**: `ServiceLineInterestRanking.tsx`

**Features Needed**:
- Drag-and-drop ranking interface (1-8)
- Experience level slider (0-5) for each service line
- Desired involvement % input (0-100%)
- Notes/reasons textarea
- Save functionality
- Visual feedback (colors, icons)

**Design Approach**:
```
Service Line Preferences
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Rank your interest in each service line (drag to reorder):

1. 🔄 Automation
   Experience: ●●●○○ (3/5)
   Desired Involvement: 40% [slider]
   Notes: [Interested in Xero automation...]

2. 💼 Advisory/Forecasting
   Experience: ●●○○○ (2/5)
   Desired Involvement: 30% [slider]
   ...
```

### 2. **VARK Assessment Integration** 🧠
**Status**: Component exists (`VARKAssessment.tsx`) but not integrated

**Where to Add**:
- Team Member Dashboard → new "My Learning Style" button
- Or: Development tab → VARK Assessment section

**What Exists**:
- ✅ `VARKAssessment.tsx` component (16 questions)
- ✅ `learning_preferences` database table
- ✅ API functions (`getLearningStyleProfile`, etc.)
- ✅ Results dashboard with recommendations

**What's Needed**:
1. Add route/button in team member portal
2. Show completion status on dashboard
3. Display learning style badge (V/A/R/K/M)
4. Use learning style in CPD recommendations

### 3. **Strategic Matching Algorithm** 🎯
**Purpose**: Match team members to service lines optimally

**Inputs**:
- Team needs (by service line)
- Individual skill gaps
- Service line interests
- Learning styles (VARK)
- Current capacity/utilization

**Outputs**:
- Recommended team deployments
- Skills development priorities
- Training assignments
- Resource allocation suggestions

**Algorithm Concept**:
```typescript
matchScore = 
  (10 - interestRank) * 10        // Interest (lower rank = higher score)
  + experienceLevel * 10           // Experience
  + avgSkillLevel * 20             // Current skills (weighted most)
  + capacityAvailable * 5          // Availability
  - currentWorkload * 3            // Balancing factor
```

## 📊 Strategic Planning Workflow (Tomorrow)

### Step 1: Partner Meeting (Your Task)
- Assign specific skills to each service line
- Define required skill levels per service line
- Set team composition targets

### Step 2: Database Updates
- Update `skills` table with service line assignments
- Define service line skill requirements

### Step 3: Team Member Input
- Each team member ranks service line interests (1-8)
- Records experience levels per service line
- Sets desired involvement percentages
- Completes VARK assessment

### Step 4: Strategic Analysis
- View `service_line_coverage` for deployment options
- Identify gaps: high-priority service lines with low interest/skills
- Match high-interest + high-skill members to service lines
- Plan training for interested members with low skills

### Step 5: Firm-Wide Plan Generation
- Algorithm suggests optimal deployments
- Highlights skill development priorities
- Shows capacity planning
- Generates training roadmap

## 💡 Strategic Value

This system enables:
- **Data-driven team deployment**: Match people to work they're interested in AND skilled at
- **Proactive skill development**: Identify gaps before they become problems
- **Employee engagement**: Give team members voice in their development path
- **Resource optimization**: Deploy the right people to the right service lines
- **Growth planning**: See where to hire vs. train

**Example Use Case**:
> "We need to expand Advisory/Forecasting services. The system shows:
> - Luke has high interest (rank #2) but low skills (avg 2.8/5)
> - Sarah has mid interest (rank #4) but high skills (avg 4.2/5)
> - Recommendation: Deploy Sarah immediately, train Luke via mentoring"
