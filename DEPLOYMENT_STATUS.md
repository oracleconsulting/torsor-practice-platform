# Torsor Practice Platform - Deployment Status

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** 🟡 **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT** (Docker Hub outage workaround active)

---

## ✅ Recent Fixes Applied (v1.0.11)

### 1. Text Contrast Issues - FIXED ✅
**Problem:** White text on light backgrounds (unreadable)

**Fixed:**
- ✅ "No skill improvements tracked yet" → Changed to black text (`text-gray-900`)
- ✅ "Predictive Improvement Modeling" title → Changed to black text (`text-gray-900`)
- ✅ "Based on your current CPD efficiency" subtitle → Changed to dark gray (`text-gray-700`)

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/accountancy/team/CPDSkillsBridge.tsx`

---

### 2. Service Line Names - UPDATED ✅
**Problem:** Service line preferences didn't match actual BSG service offerings

**Fixed:**
- ✅ Updated `BSG_SERVICE_LINES` to match current offerings:
  1. Automation
  2. Management Accounts
  3. Future Financial Information / Advisory Accelerator
  4. Benchmarking - External and Internal
  5. Profit Extraction / Remuneration Strategies
  6. 365 Alignment Programme

- ✅ Removed placeholder service lines
- ✅ Marked "Systems Audit" as "Coming Soon"

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/api/service-line-interests.ts`
- `supabase/migrations/20251020_service_line_interests.sql`

---

### 3. Database Error - DOCUMENTED ✅
**Problem:** Console error: `relation "public.service_line_interests" does not exist`

**Status:** This is **EXPECTED** until migration is applied to production database.

**Solution:** Created comprehensive migration guide:
- `SERVICE_LINE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` with:
  - Step-by-step migration instructions
  - Verification queries
  - Rollback procedures
  - BSG service line pricing details

---

## 🔧 Docker Hub Outage Workaround (Active)

### Current Build Strategy: Nixpacks ✅

**Why:** Docker Hub authentication is completely down (503 errors)

**Solution:** Using Railway's Nixpacks builder (bypasses Docker Hub entirely)

**Files:**
- ✅ `Dockerfile` → Renamed to `Dockerfile.disabled`
- ✅ `nixpacks.toml` → Created with explicit build phases
- ✅ `railway.toml` → Updated to use Nixpacks

**Build Timeline:**
- First build: ~8 minutes (downloads all packages)
- Subsequent builds: ~3-4 minutes (cached dependencies)

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Pros: Actually works during outages!
- ✅ Pros: Faster cold starts
- ✅ Pros: Better Railway integration
- ⚠️ Cons: Slightly less control than Dockerfile

---

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Required Database Migrations

Before team members can use Service Line Rankings:

1. **Apply Service Line Interests Migration**
   ```sql
   -- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
   -- File: supabase/migrations/20251020_service_line_interests.sql
   ```

2. **Verify Migration Success**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM service_line_interests;
   SELECT * FROM service_line_coverage LIMIT 5;
   ```

### Authentication & Security ✅

- ✅ Auto-login bypass removed
- ✅ Mock practice fallback removed
- ✅ Aggressive auth bypass removed
- ✅ RLS policies updated for directors/partners

### UI/UX Improvements ✅

- ✅ Skills Heatmap: Red→Green column layout
- ✅ Category accordions with mini heatmaps
- ✅ All text contrast issues resolved
- ✅ Loading state timeouts implemented
- ✅ Error handling for all Supabase queries

---

## 🚀 Current Build Status

### Railway Build Process

**Current Status:** Using Nixpacks (Docker Hub bypass)

**Build Phases:**
1. ✅ Setup → Install Node.js 20
2. ✅ Install → `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps` (5-6 min first time)
3. ✅ Build → `npm run build` (2-3 min)
4. ✅ Start → `npm run preview`

**Expected Total:** ~8 minutes for first deploy, ~3-4 min after

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails
- Check Railway logs for specific error
- Verify environment variables are set
- Ensure DATABASE_URL is correct
- Check if Docker Hub is still down (use Nixpacks workaround)

### If Users Can't Login

- Ensure RLS policies are applied
- Check browser console for auth errors

### If Data Doesn't Load
- Check Supabase logs for RLS policy errors
- Verify team member has correct `practice_id`
- Ensure migrations have been applied
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
