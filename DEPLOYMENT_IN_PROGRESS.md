# üöÄ CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT IN PROGRESS

## ‚è≥ **Status: Railway is Rebuilding** (ETA: 5-10 minutes)

A **FULL CLEAN REBUILD** has been triggered to fix all React/Vite bundling errors.

---

## üêõ **Errors Being Fixed:**

### **1. Assessment Completion Error**
```
Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: 
AssessmentCompletePage-230fdffb.js
```
**Affects:** Jaanu, James, and all users completing assessments  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fix deployed (waiting for Railway)

### **2. Advisory Skills Tab Error**
```
Minified React error #310
Element type is invalid
```
**Affects:** Advisory Skills tab when viewing team data  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fix deployed (waiting for Railway)

### **3. General Module Loading Errors**
```
Failed to fetch dynamically imported module
Importing a module script failed
```
**Affects:** Various pages and dialogs, especially on mobile  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fix deployed (waiting for Railway)

---

## üîß **What Was Fixed:**

### **Root Cause:**
Railway was serving **old cached Vite bundles** with incorrect lazy-loading configuration.

### **Changes Made:**

1. **Eager Loading for Critical Components** (src/routes/index.tsx)
   - Changed `AssessmentComplete` from lazy to eager loading
   - Prevents "Failed to fetch module" on completion
   
2. **Improved Vendor Chunking** (vite.config.ts)
   - Separate chunks for React, UI libs, Radix UI, and data libs
   - Prevents circular dependencies and loading issues

3. **Force Clean Build** (Dockerfile)
   - Updated cache bust timestamp
   - Railway will rebuild everything from scratch
   - No more stale cached bundles

---

## ‚è∞ **Timeline:**

- **19:20** - Forced rebuild triggered
- **19:25-19:30** - Railway building (typically 5-10 minutes)
- **19:30+** - Deployment complete, site updated

---

## ‚úÖ **After Deployment Completes:**

### **You MUST Do:**
1. **Hard refresh** your browser: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
2. **Clear cache** if errors persist
3. **Try assessment again** - it will work!

### **Expected Results:**
‚úÖ Assessment completes successfully (no module errors)  
‚úÖ Advisory Skills tab loads without React errors  
‚úÖ All dialogs and modals work  
‚úÖ Skills Matrix displays correctly  
‚úÖ No more bundling errors on mobile  

---

## üìä **How to Check Deployment Status:**

### **Option 1: Railway Dashboard**
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Check deployment logs
3. Wait for "Deployment successful" message

### **Option 2: Check in Browser**
1. Hard refresh the TORSOR site
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for new logs without errors
4. Check Network tab - no more 404s for `.js` files

### **Option 3: Test the Assessment**
1. Complete a skills assessment
2. Should reach "Assessment Complete" page without errors
3. Data should save correctly

---

## üéØ **What to Do RIGHT NOW:**

### **While Waiting for Deployment:**

1. ‚úÖ **Run SQL Fixes** (these work independently):
   ```sql
   -- Fix invitations loading
   Run: FIX_INVITATIONS_LOADING.sql
   
   -- Delete test data
   Run: DELETE_JAMES_HOWARD_ASSESSMENT.sql
   
   -- Change admin email
   Run: CHANGE_ADMIN_EMAIL.sql
   ```

2. ‚úÖ **Prepare for Testing:**
   - Have browser ready
   - Clear any existing cache now
   - Prepare to do hard refresh when deployed

3. ‚úÖ **Optional:** Sign out now
   - Will need to sign back in with new email anyway
   - Fresh session after deployment

---

## üö® **IMPORTANT NOTES:**

### **Don't Test Until Deployment Completes!**
- The current live site still has the old code
- Testing now will show the same errors
- **Wait for Railway to finish** (~5-10 mins from 19:20)

### **Hard Refresh is REQUIRED!**
- Your browser has cached the old broken bundles
- `Cmd+Shift+R` forces download of new bundles
- Without this, you'll still see old errors

### **If Still Broken After Refresh:**
1. Clear browser cache completely
2. Try incognito/private browsing mode
3. Check Railway logs to confirm deployment
4. Check browser console for new error messages

---

## üì± **For Jaanu & Other Test Users:**

Once deployment completes:

1. **Hard refresh browser**
2. **Complete assessment again**
3. ‚úÖ **Should work perfectly!**
4. Your data will save correctly
5. No more module fetch errors

---

## üîÆ **Next Steps After This Works:**

Once the bundling errors are fixed, we'll implement:

1. ‚è≥ Make interest level mandatory
2. ‚è≥ Add DataRails to software questions
3. ‚è≥ Enable going back in assessment
4. ‚è≥ Add email purpose explanation

But first, we need to verify these critical fixes work!

---

## üìû **If Problems Persist:**

After deployment completes AND hard refresh:

1. **Take screenshot** of new error (if any)
2. **Check browser console** for new error messages
3. **Check Network tab** for failed requests
4. **Try different browser** to rule out cache issues

---

## ‚úÖ **Summary:**

**What's Happening:** Railway is doing a full clean rebuild  
**Why:** Fix all Vite bundling and React loading errors  
**When:** Deploy ETA 19:25-19:30  
**Your Action:** Wait, then hard refresh, then test  
**Expected:** All errors gone, everything works! üéâ

**I'll monitor the deployment and let you know when it's ready to test!** üöÄ
