# Three Critical Issues - Action Plan

## Issue 1: Advisory Services Catalog Not Showing Database Skills ❌

**Problem**: The Advisory Services catalog page (`/accountancy/advisory-services`) shows hardcoded service cards but doesn't display the 84 database skill assignments.

**Why**: The catalog page uses `defaultServices` array (hardcoded). It's designed as a catalog view - you must **click on a service card** to see the detailed skills on the Service Detail page.

**Solution Options**:
1. **Quick Fix**: Add skill count badges to service cards showing "X skills assigned"
2. **Full Fix**: Load skill counts from database and display on catalog page
3. **As Designed**: Current behavior is correct - catalog shows overview, detail page shows skills

**Action**: Please **click on any service card** (e.g., "Automation") to navigate to `/accountancy/advisory-services/automation` and verify the 12 database skills display correctly.

## Issue 2: Skills Not Showing in Service Detail Page ⚠️

**Problem**: When clicking a service, the skills might not be displaying.

**Status**: Code looks correct - it loads `customSkillAssignments` from database and displays them.

**Your console shows**: `"Loaded 12 custom skill assignments"` for Automation

**Action**: 
1. Click "Automation" service card
2. Scroll down to "Required Skills Assessment" section
3. Verify you see 12 skills from database (not hardcoded ones)
4. Send screenshot if skills are NOT showing

## Issue 3: Team Members Showing Zeros in Admin Heatmap ❌

**Problem**: Admin portal skills heatmap shows zeros for team members who have completed their assessments.

**Root Cause**: Assessment data is stored in `invitations.assessment_data` (JSONB) but not migrated to `skill_assessments` table.

**Solution**: Run two SQL scripts in Supabase:

### Step 1: Diagnose (Run This First)
```sql
-- File: DIAGNOSTIC_INVITATIONS_ASSESSMENTS.sql
-- This will show you:
-- - How many invitations have assessment data
-- - Which team members have data in invitations but not in skill_assessments
-- - Sample data structure
```

Run the diagnostic and send me the results. This will tell us:
- How many team members need migration
- Whether the data structure is valid
- If there are any duplicate issues

### Step 2: Migrate (Run After Diagnosis)
```sql
-- File: MIGRATE_INVITATIONS_TO_SKILL_ASSESSMENTS.sql
-- This will:
-- ✅ Find all invitations with assessment_data
-- ✅ Create practice_members if they don't exist
-- ✅ Migrate skill assessments to skill_assessments table
-- ✅ Handle duplicates (update instead of error)
-- ✅ Validate skill_ids exist in skills table
-- ✅ Provide detailed progress logging
```

### Expected Results After Migration:
- James Howard: 111 skills
- Rizwan Paderwala: 111 skills  
- Tanya Okorji: 111 skills
- All other team members: 111 skills each
- Admin heatmap shows colored squares (not zeros)

---

## Summary of Current State

### ✅ Working:
- 84 skills assigned to 7 services in database
- Service Detail pages load skills from database
- Team member portals show all 7 services for ranking
- 111 skills in skills table

### ❌ Issues:
1. Advisory Services catalog doesn't show skill counts (design choice or bug?)
2. Admin heatmap shows zeros (missing migration from invitations)
3. Possibly: Service Detail page not displaying loaded skills (needs verification)

---

## Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Run Diagnostic**: Execute `DIAGNOSTIC_INVITATIONS_ASSESSMENTS.sql` in Supabase and send results
2. **Verify Service Detail**: Click "Automation" → send screenshot of skills section
3. **After Diagnostic**: Run `MIGRATE_INVITATIONS_TO_SKILL_ASSESSMENTS.sql`
4. **Verify Fix**: Refresh admin heatmap → all zeros should be replaced with colored squares

---

## Files Created:
- ✅ `DIAGNOSTIC_INVITATIONS_ASSESSMENTS.sql` - Check current state
- ✅ `MIGRATE_INVITATIONS_TO_SKILL_ASSESSMENTS.sql` - Fix zeros issue
- ✅ `POPULATE_SERVICE_SKILLS_FINAL.sql` - Already run (84 skills assigned)
- ✅ `SERVICE_SKILLS_STATUS.md` - Documentation

All committed to git and pushed.
