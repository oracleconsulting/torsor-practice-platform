# üöÄ QUICK FIX - Populate Skills Matrix

## Copy This SQL and Run It Now

**Go to:** https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/nwmzegonnmqzflamcxfd/sql

**Copy and paste** the contents of:
```
torsor-practice-platform/supabase/migrations/20251007_simple_skills_population.sql
```

**Or** I can paste it here for you - it's a simple migration that:

1. ‚úÖ Takes your **first 3 practice members** (whoever they are)
2. ‚úÖ Assigns them names: Emma Wilson, Michael Chen, Sarah Johnson
3. ‚úÖ Populates **all 80 skills** for each with realistic levels
4. ‚úÖ Shows verification output at the end

## What to Expect

After running, you should see:

```
NOTICE:  ===== Starting Skills Population =====
NOTICE:  Found member ID: [some-uuid]
NOTICE:  Found member ID: [some-uuid]  
NOTICE:  Found member ID: [some-uuid]
NOTICE:  Cleared existing assessments for 3 members
NOTICE:  Processing Emma Wilson (Member 1)
NOTICE:  Populated 80 skills for Emma Wilson
NOTICE:  Processing Michael Chen (Member 2)
NOTICE:  Populated 80 skills for Michael Chen
NOTICE:  Processing Sarah Johnson (Member 3)
NOTICE:  Populated 80 skills for Sarah Johnson
NOTICE:  ===== Migration Complete! =====

Then verification results:
status              total_assessments  team_members  skills_covered
Migration Complete! 240                3             80
```

## After Running

1. **Refresh your TORSOR browser tab**
2. Navigate to Team Management ‚Üí Skills Matrix
3. You should now see all 80 skills populated!

## Why This Version Is Better

The previous migration tried to:
- Create auth users (requires admin permissions)
- Insert into `practice_members` with columns that don't exist

This version:
- ‚úÖ Works with your existing `practice_members` table structure
- ‚úÖ Uses the first 3 members you already have
- ‚úÖ Just adds their skill assessments
- ‚úÖ Much simpler and safer

## Still Having Issues?

Check the browser console for:
- `‚úÖ Loaded real data: 3 members` ‚Üê Good!
- `üìä Using mock data` ‚Üê Migration didn't run or returned no data

If you see mock data, the migration didn't work. Double check the SQL ran without errors in Supabase.
