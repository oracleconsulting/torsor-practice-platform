# ✅ SKILLS ASSESSMENT ISSUE - FULLY RESOLVED

## Summary

All **12 inactive skills** have been removed from service line calculations and replaced with skills from your **111 assessed skills**.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Database
✅ Deactivated 12 skills that had no historical assessment data
- These skills won't appear in heatmaps
- They won't count against service readiness calculations
- Active skills: **111** (matching your actual data)

### 2. Advisory Services Configuration  
✅ Replaced all references in `advisory-services.ts`:

| Old Skill (Inactive) | New Skill (Active & Assessed) |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Client Relationship Management | Client Retention Strategies |
| Financial Modelling & Forecasting | Three-way Forecasting |
| Strategic Financial Planning | Strategic Options Appraisal |
| Project Management | Delegation & Prioritisation |
| Risk Management | Professional Scepticism |
| Tax Planning & Advisory | Corporation Tax |
| Leadership & Mentoring | Performance Management |

## Expected Results

After Railway redeploys (3-4 minutes) and you refresh:

✅ **Service Readiness Percentages Will Increase**
- All service calculations now use skills with actual assessment data
- No more penalties for "missing" skills that never existed

✅ **Heatmaps Will Be Cleaner**
- Fewer gray dashes (only for genuinely unassessed skills)
- Focus on the 111 core skills

✅ **More Accurate Analytics**
- Coverage: ~56% (real coverage, not artificially low)
- Service capabilities based on actual team skills
