-- ============================================================================
-- CRITICAL FINDING: Many audit, governance, and M&A skills DO NOT EXIST
-- ============================================================================
-- The 111-skill matrix focuses on:
-- - Technical accounting fundamentals
-- - Cloud accounting & automation
-- - Management accounting & reporting
-- - Advisory & consulting (financial planning focus)
-- - Digital & AI capabilities
-- - Tax & compliance
-- - Sector knowledge
-- - Client management
-- - Leadership
-- - Communication

-- It does NOT include:
-- - Formal audit skills (Internal Audit, Audit Planning, Audit Documentation)
-- - M&A skills (Mergers & Acquisitions, Due Diligence, Transaction Services)
-- - Governance/Risk Management as standalone skills
-- - Project Management
-- - Meeting Facilitation

-- RECOMMENDATION:
-- Either:
-- 1. Use "closest match" skills from the database
-- 2. Add the missing 20-30 skills to your database first
-- 3. Proceed with partial assignment (use what exists)

-- For tomorrow's presentation, I recommend Option 3: 
-- Assign the ~60-70 skills that DO exist, note the gaps, and present this as Phase 1.
