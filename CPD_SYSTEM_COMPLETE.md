### 6. **Skills Priority Algorithm - DOCUMENTED**

**Location**: `SKILLS_PRIORITY_ALGORITHM.md`

Formula: **Priority = Gap × Interest × Business Criticality**

- Gap: (Target - Current) = how much development needed
- Interest: Team member enthusiasm (1-5)
- Business Criticality: Strategic importance (1-5)

Priority Bands:
- **Critical (76-100)**: Immediate action required
- **High (51-75)**: Schedule within 1-2 months
- **Medium (26-50)**: Address within 3-6 months
- **Low (1-25)**: Optional development

## 🔒 Security (RLS Policies)

All tables have Row Level Security enabled with appropriate policies:

**CPD Activities**:
- Members can view/edit their own activities
- Managers can view team activities

**External Resources**:
- All authenticated users can view active resources
- Users can add new resources

**Knowledge Documents**:
- Public documents visible to practice team
- Users can upload their own documents

**CPD Requirements**:
- All authenticated users can view requirements

**Development Plan CPD**:
- Users can view their own linked CPD
- Managers can link CPD to team development plans

---

## 💰 Cost Tracking

All currency fields use **£ (GBP)** throughout:
- CPD activity costs
- External resource pricing
- Budget calculations

---

## 🔗 External Links Feature

### Where External Links Appear:

1. **CPD Activities**:
   - `external_link` field in database
   - Form field in "Add CPD Activity"
   - Displayed as clickable link in activities list
   - Opens in new tab with security attributes

2. **External CPD Resources**:
   - Full external resource library
   - "View Resource" buttons
   - Direct links to course providers
   - Cost and duration display

3. **Development Plans**:
   - Can link external resources to development goals
   - Recommendations from curated library

---

## 📚 Knowledge Base System

### User Story Fulfilled:

> "I want to be able to have external CPD links available in the development plans - 
> and also give staff an option to upload knowledge documents to our knowledge base 
> (basically a summary of any cpd they undertake that we can all review a summary of if we wish)"

### How It Works:

1. **Staff completes CPD activity** (course, seminar, etc.)
2. **Add CPD activity** in CPD Tracker with external link
3. **Upload knowledge document**:
   - Click "Add Document" in Knowledge Base
   - Write summary of key learnings
   - Link to the CPD activity
   - Add tags and skill categories
   - Make visible to team

4. **Team members can**:
   - Browse all knowledge documents
   - Search by keyword or tag
   - Filter by type or skill category
   - See who created it and when
   - View linked CPD activity
   - Read summaries of learning

---

## 📈 Analytics & Reporting

### Team CPD Summary Calculations:

For each team member:
- **Required Hours**: Based on role (from `cpd_requirements`)
- **Completed Hours**: Sum of verified/claimed hours from completed activities
- **Verifiable Hours**: Sum from activities marked as verifiable
- **Planned Hours**: Sum from planned activities
- **Progress %**: (Completed / Required) × 100
- **Last Activity**: Most recent activity date

### Dashboard Metrics:
- Team overall progress
- Total hours logged
- Compliance count (members meeting requirements)
- Days remaining until year end
- At-risk members (< 70% progress)
