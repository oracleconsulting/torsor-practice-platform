## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**

### **1. ACTIVATE THE REDESIGN (Choose One)**

#### **OPTION A: Replace Current Page** ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**

```bash
cd /Users/James.Howard/Documents/OracleConsultingAI/torsor-practice-platform

# Backup current page
mv src/pages/accountancy/team/AdvisorySkillsPage.tsx src/pages/accountancy/team/AdvisorySkillsPage.backup.tsx

# Activate redesigned page
mv src/pages/accountancy/team/AdvisorySkillsPageRedesigned.tsx src/pages/accountancy/team/AdvisorySkillsPage.tsx

# Import high contrast CSS in main app
echo "import './styles/high-contrast.css';" >> src/index.css

# Test locally
npm run dev
# Visit: http://localhost:5173/team

# If good, deploy
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: Activate Advisory Skills v2.0 redesign"
git push origin main
```

**Deployment Time:** ~2 minutes (Railway auto-deploy)

#### **OPTION B: Test on Separate Route First** (Safer)

**Step 1:** Add new route to test alongside old version

**Edit:** `src/routes/accountancy.tsx`

// Add this import
import AdvisorySkillsPageRedesigned from '@/pages/accountancy/team/AdvisorySkillsPageRedesigned';

// Add this route
<Route path="team/skills-v2" element={<AdvisorySkillsPageRedesigned />} />
```

**Step 2:** Test both versions
- Old: `/team` (existing)
- New: `/team/skills-v2` (redesign)

**Step 3:** When satisfied, switch to Option A above
