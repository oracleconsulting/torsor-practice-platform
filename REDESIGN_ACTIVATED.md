# 🎨 v2.0 REDESIGNED UI - NOW ACTIVATED!

## What Just Happened?

**THE ISSUE:** 
You said "the UI is no different to before we made 'changes'"

**THE REASON:**
All the new UI components (sidebar, FAB, breadcrumbs, overview tab, etc.) were created and deployed to Railway, BUT they were never activated! The routes were still pointing to the OLD `AdvisorySkillsPage.tsx` instead of the NEW `AdvisorySkillsPageRedesigned.tsx`.

**THE FIX:**
✅ Changed `TeamManagementPage.tsx` to import and use `AdvisorySkillsPageRedesigned`  
✅ Committed and pushed to GitHub  
✅ Railway is now deploying the activated UI

## 🎯 What Was The Problem?

**The Confusion:**
1. We created `AdvisorySkillsPageRedesigned.tsx` with all new features
2. We pushed it to GitHub
3. Railway deployed it
4. **BUT** the routes were still using the OLD `AdvisorySkillsPage.tsx`

It's like building a new house but never moving into it! All the furniture was delivered, but you were still living in the old house.

**The Solution:**
Changed the "address" in `TeamManagementPage.tsx` to point to the new house (AdvisorySkillsPageRedesigned).
