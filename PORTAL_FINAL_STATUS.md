## 🚧 Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Email System
**Current State:**
- ✅ UI for invitations complete
- ⚠️ Email sending not yet connected to SMTP
- 🔄 Using copy-link workaround

**To Implement** (Optional - Week 2):
```typescript
// Add to team-portal.ts
import nodemailer from 'nodemailer';

export async function sendInvitationEmail(to: string, inviteLink: string) {
  const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({...});
  await transporter.sendMail({
    to,
    subject: 'Join Our Skills Portal',
    html: emailTemplate,
  });
}
```

### Bulk Operations
**Current State:**
- ✅ Single invite at a time
- ⚠️ No CSV import

**To Implement** (Optional - Week 3):
- CSV upload for bulk invites
- Batch status updates
- Export reports to Excel

### Advanced Analytics
**Current State:**
- ✅ Basic team stats
- ✅ Service line coverage
- ⚠️ No trend analysis over time

**To Implement** (Optional - Month 2):
- Historical tracking
- Skill development velocity
- Predictive gaps based on business growth

---

## 📊 Migration Path

### From Current State (3 members with skills)
**No migration needed!** The portal works with existing data.

Just run new migrations to add portal tables:
```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -f supabase/migrations/20251008_team_portal_setup.sql
psql $DATABASE_URL -f supabase/migrations/20251008_bsg_skills_matrix.sql
```

### For 16-Person Team
**Recommended Approach:**
1. Keep existing 3 members' data
2. Create 13 new invitations
3. New members self-assess
4. Update old assessments if needed

**Alternative (Clean Start):**
1. Clear `skill_assessments` table
2. All 16 members start fresh with BSG skills
3. Uniform data structure

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Development Time
- **Day 1**: Portal build (100% complete)
