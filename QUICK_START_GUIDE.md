**Steps:**

1. **Add Railway Variables** (2 min)
   
   Go to: https://railway.app ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Variables
   
   Add these 3 variables:
   ```bash
   VITE_RESEND_API_KEY=re_gNeRqnEt_MxFb413pA2FZKFsCLD1XeBGC
   VITE_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev
   VITE_FROM_NAME=RPGCC Team Portal
   ```

### **Solution B: Production Mode (30 min) - Verify Domain**

Required to invite your actual team members to their RPGCC emails.

**What this does:**
- Emails send to ANY address (@rpgcc.co.uk, @rpgcc.com, etc.)
- Professional sender: `noreply@rpgcc.co.uk`
- No restrictions

**Steps:**

#### 1. Verify Domain in Resend (15 min)

2. **Click "Add Domain"**
3. **Enter:** `rpgcc.co.uk` (or `rpgcc.com` if you prefer)
4. **Resend shows DNS records to add**

   Example records you'll need to add:
   ```
   Type: TXT
   Name: _resend
   Value: resend_verify_abc123xyz...
   
   Type: MX
   Name: @
   Value: mx.resend.com
   Priority: 10
   
   Type: TXT
   Name: @
   Value: v=DMARC1; p=none; ...
   ```

5. **Add DNS Records** (depends on your DNS provider)
   
   - **Cloudflare**: Dashboard ‚Üí DNS ‚Üí Add Record
   - **GoDaddy**: Domain Settings ‚Üí Manage DNS
   - **Namecheap**: Domain List ‚Üí Manage ‚Üí Advanced DNS
   - **Google Domains**: DNS ‚Üí Custom Records

6. **Wait for Verification** (5-15 minutes)
   
   Resend checks DNS automatically. You'll see ‚úÖ when ready.

#### 2. Update Railway Variables (2 min)

Change the from email to use your verified domain:

```bash
VITE_RESEND_API_KEY=re_gNeRqnEt_MxFb413pA2FZKFsCLD1XeBGC
VITE_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@rpgcc.co.uk  # ‚Üê Changed from onboarding@resend.dev
VITE_FROM_NAME=RPGCC Team Portal
```

#### 3. Test Production Email (1 min)

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.resend.com/emails' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer re_gNeRqnEt_MxFb413pA2FZKFsCLD1XeBGC' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "from": "noreply@rpgcc.co.uk",
    "to": ["jhoward@rpgcc.co.uk"],
    "subject": "Test from verified domain",
    "html": "<h1>It works!</h1>"
  }'
```

Should return: `{"id":"..."}` (success!)

#### 4. Invite Team (2 min)

## üìß **DNS Records Quick Reference**

When verifying domain, Resend typically needs these 3 records:

| Type | Name | Value | Priority |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| TXT | `_resend` | `resend_verify_...` (Resend provides) | - |
| MX | `@` or `rpgcc.co.uk` | `mx.resend.com` | 10 |
| TXT | `@` or `rpgcc.co.uk` | `v=DMARC1; p=none;...` (Resend provides) | - |

**Note:** Exact values come from Resend dashboard. Don't guess these!

---

## üÜò **Common Issues**

### "Domain verification taking too long"

**Cause:** DNS propagation delay  
**Fix:** 
- Check DNS records are entered correctly
- Use DNS checker: https://dnschecker.org
- Wait 15-30 minutes for propagation
- Some DNS providers are faster (Cloudflare = minutes, GoDaddy = hours)

### "Still can't send to team emails after verification"

**Cause:** From email doesn't match verified domain  
**Fix:**
- Make sure `VITE_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@rpgcc.co.uk`
- Domain in from email MUST match verified domain
- Redeploy Railway after changing variable

### "Test mode restriction returned"

**Cause:** Domain verification expired or removed  
**Fix:**
- Check Resend dashboard shows ‚úÖ verified
- Re-verify if needed
- Check DNS records still exist
