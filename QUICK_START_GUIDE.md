## üéØ What's New?

You now have two major upgrades in your TORSOR Accounting Portal:

### 1. Business Systems Audit
Track and improve your clients' operational efficiency

### 2. Enhanced Client Outreach
Find acquisition targets and track firm movements over time

---

## üìã Systems Audit - Quick Start

### What It Does
Analyzes your clients' business systems (not IT security!) to find:
- Time-wasting manual processes
- Money leaks
- Cashflow improvement opportunities

### Systems Covered
1. **Invoicing** - How they create and send invoices
2. **Payments** - How fast they collect money
3. **Expenses** - How they track and approve expenses
4. **Payroll** - Payroll processing efficiency
5. **Inventory** - Stock management
6. **Procurement** - Purchase order systems
7. **Banking** - Bank reconciliation
8. **Reporting** - Financial dashboards and KPIs

### How to Use
1. Open TORSOR ‚Üí **Systems Audit**
2. Select a client (or view all)
3. See the **Efficiency Score** (0-100)
4. Review **Potential Savings** card:
   - Time saved per month
   - Cost reduction per month
   - Cashflow improvements
5. Filter by category (e.g., "Invoicing")
6. Each item shows:
   - ‚úÖ Optimized (working well)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Attention (could be better)
   - ‚ùå Inefficient (costing time/money)
   - üîÑ Pending Review (not assessed yet)

### Example Finding
```
System: Invoice Generation & Delivery
Status: ‚ùå Inefficient
Problem: Manual invoice creation taking 2 hours/week
Savings: ¬£400/month
Efficiency: 87% time saved
Recommendation: Implement Xero/QuickBooks automation
```

### Business Value
- Show clients **specific** savings amounts
- Position yourself as a **business advisor**, not just compliance

## üîç Client Outreach - Quick Start

### What It Does
Helps you find new clients by:
1. **Tracking firm movements** between accounting firms
2. **Comparing date ranges** to see who's leaving/joining
3. **Verifying addresses** with AI so you can actually contact them
4. **Saving search history** for easy access

---

## Feature 1: Date Range Comparison

### What Problem Does This Solve?
You want to find firms that have **left their accountant** (potential clients for you), or track which accounting firms are **acquiring clients** (potential acquisition targets).

### How It Works
Compare two time periods to see:
- **New Firms** üü¢ - Joined the accountant (acquisitions)
- **Left Firms** üî¥ - Left the accountant (available clients!)
- **Unchanged** üîµ - Still there (stable base)

### Step-by-Step
1. Go to **Client Outreach** ‚Üí **Date Range Comparison**
2. Enter a registered office address (e.g., competing accountant's office)
3. Set **Period 1** (earlier):
   - Start: 2024-01-01
   - End: 2024-06-30
4. Set **Period 2** (later):
   - Start: 2024-07-01
   - End: 2024-12-31
5. Click **"Compare Periods"**
6. See results:
   - 15 New Firms (they're acquiring!)
   - 8 Left Firms (approach these!)
   - 120 Unchanged (stable client base)

### Real-World Use Case
**Scenario:** You want to acquire a local accounting firm.

**Steps:**
1. Run date comparison on their address
2. See they have 150 clients (Period 1)
3. See they now have 165 clients (Period 2) - growing!
4. See 20 clients left them - approach those firms
5. See 35 new clients joined - they're expanding
6. **Decision:** Good acquisition target - growing client base

## Feature 2: Search History

### What It Does
Automatically saves all your searches so you can:
- Come back later and reload them
- Track patterns over time
- Share with team members

### How to Use
1. Just run any search (address match, date comparison)
2. It automatically saves to the **Search History** panel (right side)
3. Click any saved search to reload it instantly
4. Delete old searches you don't need
5. See when you ran it and how many results

### Example
```
üìç Address Match
   "123 High Street, London"
   45 results
   2 hours ago
   
üóìÔ∏è Date Comparison
   "Baker Street Accountants"
   Comparing Jan-Jun vs Jul-Dec
   125 results
   Yesterday
```

## Feature 3: LLM Address Verification ‚≠ê

### What Problem Does This Solve?
**Problem:** When you search for firms at an accounting office, you get their **registered office** address. That's the accountant's office - you can't reach out there!

**Solution:** AI (GPT-5 or Perplexity) searches the web to find their **real trading address** and **contact address**.

### How It Works
1. Run an address search (finds 50 companies)
2. Go to **Address Verification** tab
3. Click **"Verify All Addresses"**
4. AI checks:
   - Company websites
   - Google Maps
   - Business directories
   - Public records
5. Returns:
   - **Trading Address** - Where they actually work
   - **Contact Address** - Where to send mail
   - **Confidence Score** - How sure AI is (0-100%)

### Example Result
```
Company: ABC Manufacturing Ltd
Registered Office: 123 High St (accountant's office)

‚úÖ Trading Address Found (95% confidence)
   ‚Üí 45 Industrial Park, Birmingham B12 3XY
   
‚úÖ Contact Address Found (88% confidence)
   ‚Üí Same as trading address
   
Sources: Company website, Google Business Profile
```

### Why This Is Powerful
- **Save hours** of manual research per firm
- **Higher response rates** - you're contacting the right place
- **Professional** - shows you did your homework
- **Scalable** - process 100+ firms in minutes

### Pricing Note
LLM verification uses AI API calls (GPT-5 or Perplexity):
- Cost: ~¬£0.01-0.05 per company
- For 100 companies: ¬£1-5
- Worth it for accurate data!

## Feature 4: Enhanced Export

### What It Does
Exports **ALL available data** for firms in your search:
- Basic info (name, number, status)
- Full address details
- Officers and roles
- Filing history
- Charges/mortgages
- People with Significant Control (PSC)
- **Optional:** LLM-verified addresses

### How to Use
1. Run an address search
2. Click **"Export All Data"** button
3. Choose format (CSV or JSON)
4. Optional: Include LLM verification (adds trading addresses)
5. Download file

### Use in Your Workflow
1. **Export** firms at a target accounting office
2. **Import** to your CRM (e.g., HubSpot, Salesforce)
3. **Verify** addresses with LLM
4. **Create** outreach campaign
5. **Contact** using real trading addresses

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Backend Setup Required
The frontend is ready, but you need to set up the backend API:

1. **LLM Integration**
   - Get GPT-5 API key from OpenAI, OR
   - Get Perplexity API key
   - Add to environment variables

2. **API Endpoints**
   These need to be implemented in `oracle_api_server`:
   - Date range filtering
   - Date range comparison
   - LLM address verification (single & batch)
   - Enhanced export

3. **Database Migration**
   Run the search history migration:
   ```bash
   # In torsor-practice-platform directory
   supabase migration up
   ```

### Cost Considerations
- **Companies House API** - Free, but rate limited (600/5min)
- **LLM Verification** - ~¬£0.01-0.05 per company
- **Storage** - Search history stored in Supabase (minimal cost)
