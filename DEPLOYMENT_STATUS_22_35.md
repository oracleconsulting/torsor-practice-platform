# 🚀 Deployment Status - 22:35 (Oct 10, 2025)

## 📊 **Current Situation**

### ✅ **What's Working:**
- Database cleaned: 2 real members (Luke + Jaanu)
- Direct Supabase access enabled
- Code pushed to GitHub successfully
- Workaround in place (Team Metrics tab disabled)

### ❌ **What's NOT Working:**
- **Railway is NOT deploying our fixes!**
- Browser still shows old bundle: `index-8648972c.js`
- React error #310 persists because old code is still live
- Advisory Skills page crashes because of the error

---

## 🔧 **What I Just Did (22:35)**

### Aggressive Cache-Busting Deploy:
1. ✅ Modified Dockerfile to change Docker layer hash (added `git` package)
2. ✅ Added VERSION file to track deployments
3. ✅ Committed and pushed to GitHub
4. ✅ Created deployment monitoring script

**This FORCES Railway to do a complete rebuild from scratch.**

---

## ⏱️ **What to Expect**

### Timeline:
- **Now (22:35)**: Code pushed, Railway should start building
- **22:40-22:45**: Railway build should complete (5-10 min)
- **After build**: New bundle hash will appear

### How to Check if it Deployed:

#### Option 1: Run the Monitoring Script
```bash
cd /Users/James.Howard/Documents/OracleConsultingAI/torsor-practice-platform
bash check-deployment.sh
```

This will:
- Check the production URL
- Compare bundle hash
- Tell you if deployment is live

#### Option 2: Check Railway Dashboard
1. Go to: https://railway.app/project/[your-project-id]
2. Click on **"torsor-practice-platform"** service
3. Go to **"Deployments"** tab
4. Look for a new deployment starting at ~22:35
5. Watch the build logs

#### Option 3: Manual Check
1. Go to: https://torsor-practice-platform-production.up.railway.app/team
2. Open DevTools (F12)
3. Look at Console for bundle filename
4. If it's NOT `index-8648972c.js`, deployment worked!

## 🎯 **Once Deployment is Live**

### Step 1: Hard Refresh Browser
```
Cmd + Shift + R
```

### Step 2: Verify the Fix
Check that:
- ✅ **New bundle hash** (not `8648972c`)
- ✅ **No React error #310** in console
- ✅ **"2 members"** in console log
- ✅ **Advisory Skills page loads**
- ✅ **5 tabs showing** (Team Metrics hidden)

### Step 3: Test the Page
1. Click on **"Advisory Skills"** tab
2. It should load without errors
3. You should see Luke and Jaanu's data
4. All other tabs should work (except Team Metrics is hidden)

---

## 🚨 **If Railway STILL Doesn't Deploy**

### Nuclear Option: Manual Deploy
1. Go to Railway → Deployments
2. Click **"Deploy"** → **"From Branch: main"**
3. This bypasses auto-deploy and forces a manual deployment

### Check Auto-Deploy Settings
1. Railway → Service → Settings
2. Scroll to **"Source"** section
3. Verify **"Deploy on Push"** is **ON**
4. If OFF, turn it ON

### Check Webhooks
1. GitHub → Your Repo → Settings → Webhooks
2. Look for `railway.app` webhook
3. Check "Recent Deliveries" for errors
4. If errors, regenerate webhook in Railway

## 📋 **Deployment Attempts Log**

| Time | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| 19:50 | First fix (comparePeriods removal) | ❌ Not deployed |
| 22:00 | Cache bust #1 | ❌ Not deployed |
| 22:15 | Cache bust #2 | ❌ Not deployed |
| 22:30 | Team Metrics disable workaround | ❌ Not deployed |
| **22:35** | **Aggressive Docker layer change** | ⏳ **IN PROGRESS** |

## 🔍 **Why is Railway Not Deploying?**

### Possible Causes:
1. **Docker Cache Stuck**: Railway using old cached layers
2. **Auto-Deploy OFF**: Pushes not triggering builds
3. **Webhook Broken**: GitHub not notifying Railway
4. **Build Queue**: Railway is backed up
5. **Service Misconfigured**: Wrong branch or path

### Our Fix:
- Changed Docker layer (added `git` package)
- This **FORCES** all layers to rebuild
- Cannot use cache, must rebuild from scratch

---

## 📞 **Support Resources**

### Railway Status:
- https://railway.app/status

### Railway Discord:
- If this doesn't work, ping Railway support
- They can manually trigger deployments

### Rollback Plan:
If nothing works, we can:
1. Deploy to a different service (Render, Vercel, etc.)
2. Use Railway CLI to force deploy
3. Create a new Railway service from scratch

- ✅ NO "Error: Minified React error #310"
- ✅ Advisory Skills page loads successfully
- ✅ 5 tabs visible (Team Metrics hidden as workaround)
