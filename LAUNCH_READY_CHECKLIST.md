## 📋 Your To-Do List (Before Monday Launch)

### Step 1: Run Database Migrations (15 minutes)

Open your comprehensive guide:
```
📄 torsor-practice-platform/FIX_INVITATION_AND_CPD_SETUP.md
```

**In Supabase SQL Editor** (https://supabase.com/dashboard), run these 3 migrations **in order**:

1. **Fix RLS Recursion** ✅
   ```sql
   -- Copy from: supabase/migrations/20251008_fix_rls_recursion.sql
   -- Fixes: infinite recursion in practice_members
   ```

2. **Create Invitations System** ✅
   ```sql
   -- Copy from: supabase/migrations/20251008_invitations_system.sql
   -- Creates: invitations, invitation_events, invitation_batches tables
   ```

3. **Add CPD Configuration** ✅
   ```sql
   -- Copy from: supabase/migrations/20251008_cpd_configuration.sql
   -- Adds: CPD settings to practices table, cpd_tracker enhancements
   ```

**Verification Query** (run after all 3):
```sql
SELECT 
  '1. Invitations' as check_name,
  CASE WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'invitations')
    THEN '✅ EXISTS' ELSE '❌ MISSING' END as status
UNION ALL
SELECT '2. RLS Fixed',
  CASE WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'get_user_practice_ids')
    THEN '✅ FIXED' ELSE '❌ NOT FIXED' END
UNION ALL
SELECT '3. CPD Config',
  CASE WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns 
    WHERE table_name = 'practices' AND column_name = 'cpd_total_expected_hours')
    THEN '✅ ADDED' ELSE '❌ MISSING' END;
```

**Expected Result**: All ✅ EXISTS/FIXED/ADDED

---

### Step 2: Clean Database (2 minutes)

**In Supabase SQL Editor**, run this to remove Emma, Michael, Sarah:

```sql
DO $$
DECLARE
    deleted_assessments INT;
    deleted_goals INT;
    deleted_sessions INT;
    deleted_members INT;
BEGIN
    RAISE NOTICE '=== Removing Mock Data ===';
    
    DELETE FROM skill_assessments 
    WHERE team_member_id IN (SELECT id FROM practice_members);
    GET DIAGNOSTICS deleted_assessments = ROW_COUNT;
    
    DELETE FROM development_goals 
    WHERE practice_member_id IN (SELECT id FROM practice_members);
    GET DIAGNOSTICS deleted_goals = ROW_COUNT;
    
    DELETE FROM survey_sessions 
    WHERE practice_member_id IN (SELECT id FROM practice_members);
    GET DIAGNOSTICS deleted_sessions = ROW_COUNT;
    
    DELETE FROM practice_members;
    GET DIAGNOSTICS deleted_members = ROW_COUNT;
    
    RAISE NOTICE 'Deleted % practice members', deleted_members;
    RAISE NOTICE '=== ✅ Database Cleaned! ===';
END $$;
```

**Expected**: `Deleted 3 practice members` (or whatever was in there)

---

### Step 3: Configure Email Service (5 minutes)

**In Railway** (https://railway.app/), add environment variables:

```bash
VITE_RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_resend_api_key_here

VITE_FROM_NAME=RPGCC Team Portal
```

**Get your Resend API Key**:
1. Go to https://resend.com/api-keys
2. Create new API key
3. Copy and paste into Railway

**Then**: Deploy in Railway (automatic after env var change)
