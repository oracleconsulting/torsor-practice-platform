## ‚úÖ Completed Actions

### 1. Database Population
Successfully populated `service_skill_assignments` table with **84 skill assignments** across **7 service lines**:

| Service Line | Skills | Critical | Avg Min Level | Avg Ideal Level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Automation | 12 | 6 | 2.8 | 3.8 |
| 2. Management Accounts | 14 | 7 | 3.1 | 4.1 |

### 2. Service ID Corrections
Fixed service IDs to match the application:
- ‚úÖ `automation` ‚Üí Automation
- ‚úÖ `management-accounts` ‚Üí Management Accounts
- ‚úÖ `advisory-accelerator` ‚Üí Advisory / Future Financial Information
- ‚úÖ `benchmarking` ‚Üí Benchmarking
- ‚úÖ `365-alignment` ‚Üí 365 Alignment Programme
- ‚úÖ `systems-audit` ‚Üí Systems Audit
- ‚úÖ `profit-extraction` ‚Üí Profit Extraction / Fractional CFO-COO Services

## üìç Where Skills Are Displayed

### Admin Portal
1. **Advisory Services Page** (`/accountancy/advisory-services`)
   - Shows all 7 service lines as cards
   - Click any service ‚Üí navigates to detailed view

2. **Service Detail Page** (`/accountancy/services/:serviceId`)
   - Loads custom skill assignments from database via `getServiceSkillAssignments()`
   - Displays skills with minimum/ideal levels
   - Shows which team members have each skill
   - Allows assigning skills to workflow stages

3. **Skills Management Page** (`/accountancy/skills`)
   - Shows all 111 skills by category
   - Each skill displays which advisory services it's assigned to as badges
   - Data comes from expanded skill view

### Team Member Portal
1. **Service Line Preferences** (`/team-member/service-lines`)
   - Lists all 7 service lines for ranking
   - Shows descriptions and features for each service
   - Team members drag to rank by interest
   - Saves to `service_line_interests` table

2. **Skills Assessment** (`/team-member/assessment`)
   - Shows all 111 skills for self-assessment
   - Each skill shows which service line it belongs to
   - Team members rate current level and interest

## üîÑ How It All Works Together

### Data Flow:
1. **Skills** ‚Üí Base 111-skill matrix in `skills` table
2. **Service Skills** ‚Üí Custom assignments in `service_skill_assignments` table (‚úÖ NOW POPULATED)
3. **Team Skills** ‚Üí Individual assessments in `skill_assessments` table
4. **Service Interests** ‚Üí Rankings in `service_line_interests` table

### Matching Algorithm:
The system uses `service_line_coverage` view which combines:
- Team member skill levels
- Service skill requirements  
- Interest rankings
- Experience levels

This generates optimal team deployment recommendations.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

The `advisoryServicesMap` in `src/lib/advisory-services-skills-mapping.ts` contains **hardcoded skill names** that don't match your 111-skill database. These are only used for display purposes and initial setup.

The **actual skill assignments** now come from the `service_skill_assignments` database table, which correctly uses your 111 assessed skills.

## üéØ Next Steps (If Needed)

1. **Add more skills to services**: Use the Service Detail Page UI to assign additional skills
2. **Adjust levels**: Edit minimum/ideal levels directly in the database or through the UI
3. **Mark critical skills**: Update `is_critical` flag for must-have skills
4. **Add seniority requirements**: Populate `required_seniority` arrays

## üìä Verification

Run this query to see current state:
```sql
SELECT 
  CASE ssa.service_id
    WHEN 'automation' THEN '1. Automation'
    WHEN 'management-accounts' THEN '2. Management Accounts'
    WHEN 'advisory-accelerator' THEN '3. Advisory'
    WHEN 'benchmarking' THEN '4. Benchmarking'
    WHEN '365-alignment' THEN '5. 365 Alignment'
    WHEN 'systems-audit' THEN '6. Systems Audit'
    WHEN 'profit-extraction' THEN '7. Profit Extraction / Fractional CFO-COO'
  END as service_name,
  s.name as skill_name,
  s.category,
  ssa.minimum_level,
  ssa.ideal_level,
  ssa.is_critical
FROM service_skill_assignments ssa
JOIN skills s ON s.id = ssa.skill_id
WHERE ssa.practice_id = (SELECT id FROM practices WHERE name = 'RPGCC')
ORDER BY ssa.service_id, s.category, s.name;
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete and operational across admin and team member portals.
