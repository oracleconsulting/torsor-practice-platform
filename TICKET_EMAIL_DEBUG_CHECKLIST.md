# 🔍 TICKET EMAIL DEBUGGING - API Key Already Configured

## Issue
Admin replied to ticket but team member didn't receive email notification.
Resend API key IS configured (invitations work).

---

## 🎯 Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Check Browser Console (Admin Panel)

After you replied to the ticket, the browser console should show one of:

**✅ Success:**
```
✅ Email notification sent to: jameshowardivc@gmail.com
```

**⚠️ Warning:**
```
⚠️ Email notification failed: [error message]
```

**❌ Error:**
```
Error sending email notification: [error details]
```

**What to look for:**
- Does it show the correct email address?
- Is there an error message?
- Does it say "Email sent successfully"?

---

### Step 2: Check Database

Run `DIAGNOSTIC_TICKET_EMAILS.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor to check:

1. **Does the ticket have an email?**
   - Look at `support_tickets.submitter_email`
   - Should be: `jameshowardivc@gmail.com` (or whoever raised the ticket)

2. **Was the email marked as sent?**
   - Look at `ticket_replies.email_sent`
   - Should be: `TRUE` if email was sent

3. **When was it sent?**
   - Look at `ticket_replies.email_sent_at`
   - Should have a timestamp

### Step 3: Check Resend Dashboard

1. Go to: https://resend.com/dashboard
2. Click **"Emails"** in sidebar
3. Look for recent sends
4. Check status:
   - ✅ **Delivered** - Email was sent successfully
   - ⏳ **Queued** - Still processing
   - ❌ **Failed** - Check error message

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Issue 1: Wrong Email Address
**Symptom**: Email sent but to wrong address  
**Fix**: Check `practice_members.email` in database

### Issue 2: Email in Spam
**Symptom**: `email_sent = TRUE` but not in inbox  
**Fix**: Check spam/junk folder

### Issue 3: Resend Quota Exceeded
**Symptom**: Error: "Daily sending quota exceeded"  
**Fix**: Wait for quota reset or upgrade plan

### Issue 4: Invalid Recipient Email
**Symptom**: Error: "Invalid recipient email"  
**Fix**: Verify email format in database

### Issue 5: Sender Email Not Verified
**Symptom**: Error: "Sender email not verified"

## 🔧 Manual Test

To test if emails are working at all:

1. Raise a NEW ticket as a team member
2. Reply to it as admin
3. Check console immediately after clicking "Send Reply"
4. Note exactly what it says

---

## 💡 Most Likely Causes

Since invitations work, the API is configured correctly. Most likely:

1. **Spam folder** - Check there first!
2. **Wrong email in database** - Run diagnostic SQL
3. **Resend throttling** - Too many emails sent recently
4. **Domain issues** - If using custom domain, DNS might not be propagated

---

## 🆘 Next Steps

**Tell me:**
1. What does the browser console say when you send the reply?
2. What email address is in the `submitter_email` field? (run diagnostic SQL)
3. What does `email_sent` show in ticket_replies?

Then I can pinpoint the exact issue! 🎯
