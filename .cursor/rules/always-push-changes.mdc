# Always push changes to git

After you make any code or config changes in this repo:

1. **Stage** all changes, excluding backup/scratch files (e.g. `*.bak`, `*.disk_copy`, `*.orig`).
2. **Commit** with a short, descriptive message that summarizes what changed.
3. **Push** to `origin main` (or the current branch).

Do this in the same turn as your edits when possible. Do not wait for the user to ask you to push.

- Run git commands from the **torsor-practice-platform** directory (this repo’s root).
- If the user only asked for a small fix (e.g. one file), the commit message can be one line; for larger work, use a few lines or a bullet list.
