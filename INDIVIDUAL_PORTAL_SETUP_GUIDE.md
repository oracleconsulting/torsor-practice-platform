# üöÄ Individual Team Member Portal Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you set up auth accounts for all 16 team members, enabling them to access their individual portals with mandatory password changes on first login.

---

## üìã STEP 1: Add Password Change Columns to Database

**Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- Add password change tracking columns
ALTER TABLE practice_members
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS password_change_required BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_password_change TIMESTAMPTZ;

-- Add helper functions
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_password_change_required(user_email TEXT)
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
DECLARE
  requires_change BOOLEAN;
BEGIN
  SELECT pm.password_change_required INTO requires_change
  FROM practice_members pm
  WHERE pm.email = user_email
  LIMIT 1;
  
  RETURN COALESCE(requires_change, false);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION mark_password_changed(user_email TEXT)
RETURNS VOID AS $$
BEGIN
  UPDATE practice_members
  SET 
    password_change_required = false,
    last_password_change = NOW()
  WHERE email = user_email;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

---

## üìã STEP 2: Get List of Team Members Without Auth Accounts

**Run this query to see who needs accounts:**

```sql
SELECT 
  pm.id AS practice_member_id,
  pm.email,
  pm.name,
  pm.role,
  CASE 
    WHEN pm.user_id IS NOT NULL THEN '‚úÖ Has Account'
    ELSE '‚ùå Needs Account'
  END AS account_status
FROM practice_members pm
WHERE pm.practice_id = (SELECT id FROM practices WHERE name = 'Torsor' LIMIT 1)
  AND pm.is_active = true
ORDER BY 
  CASE WHEN pm.user_id IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE 1 END,
  pm.name;
```

---

## üìã STEP 3: Create Auth Accounts in Supabase

### Standard Password for All: `TorsorTeam2025!`

For each team member without an account:

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí **Authentication** ‚Üí **Users** ‚Üí **Add User**
2. Enter their **email** from the list above
3. Enter password: **`TorsorTeam2025!`**
4. **Auto-confirm email**: ‚úÖ YES
5. Click **Create User**
6. **Copy the generated user_id**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Get Email Addresses from Database

**DO NOT use hardcoded email addresses!** Run this query first:

```sql
SELECT 
  pm.name,
  pm.email,
  pm.role,
  CASE 
    WHEN pm.user_id IS NOT NULL THEN '‚úÖ Has Auth Account'
    ELSE '‚ùå Needs Auth Account'
  END AS "Auth Status"
FROM practice_members pm
WHERE pm.practice_id = (SELECT id FROM practices WHERE name = 'Torsor' LIMIT 1)
  AND pm.is_active = true
ORDER BY pm.name;
```

**Use the actual email addresses from the `pm.email` column above.**

You'll see approximately 16 team members with their REAL email addresses. Create auth accounts for anyone showing "‚ùå Needs Auth Account".

---

## üìã STEP 4: Link Auth Accounts to Practice Members

**After creating each auth account, run this for each user:**

```sql
-- Template - Replace USER_ID and EMAIL for each person
-- USE THE ACTUAL EMAIL FROM THE DATABASE QUERY ABOVE!
UPDATE practice_members
SET 
  user_id = 'PASTE_USER_ID_HERE',
  password_change_required = true,
  updated_at = NOW()
WHERE email = 'PASTE_ACTUAL_EMAIL_FROM_DATABASE_HERE'
  AND practice_id = (SELECT id FROM practices WHERE name = 'Torsor' LIMIT 1);
```

**Example (using actual email from database):**
```sql
UPDATE practice_members
SET 
  user_id = 'a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-123456789abc',
  password_change_required = true,
  updated_at = NOW()
WHERE email = 'luke@torsor.co.uk'  -- ‚¨ÖÔ∏è USE ACTUAL EMAIL FROM DATABASE!
  AND practice_id = (SELECT id FROM practices WHERE name = 'Torsor' LIMIT 1);
```

**üí° TIP:** Keep a spreadsheet to track:
- Name
- Email
- Generated user_id
- Status (Created / Linked / Tested)

---

## üìã STEP 5: Verify All Accounts Are Linked

```sql
SELECT 
  pm.name,
  pm.email,
  pm.role,
  u.id AS user_id,
  u.email AS auth_email,
  u.email_confirmed_at,
  pm.password_change_required,
  CASE 
    WHEN pm.user_id IS NOT NULL AND u.id IS NOT NULL THEN '‚úÖ Linked & Ready'
    WHEN pm.user_id IS NULL THEN '‚ùå Not Linked'
    ELSE '‚ö†Ô∏è Issue'
  END AS status
FROM practice_members pm
LEFT JOIN auth.users u ON pm.user_id = u.id
WHERE pm.practice_id = (SELECT id FROM practices WHERE name = 'Torsor' LIMIT 1)
  AND pm.is_active = true
ORDER BY status, pm.name;
```

**Expected Result:** All team members should show **"‚úÖ Linked & Ready"**

---

## üìã STEP 6: Test Login Flow

### Test with a Team Member (e.g., Luke if he's an Assistant Manager):

1. **Go to**: `https://torsor.co.uk/auth`
2. **Email**: `[Luke's actual email from database]`
3. **Password**: `TorsorTeam2025!`
4. **Expected Flow**:
   - ‚úÖ Login successful
   - ‚úÖ Redirected to `/team-member` (his portal, NOT admin dashboard)
   - ‚úÖ Orange banner appears: "Password Change Required"
   - ‚úÖ Modal auto-opens (mandatory, cannot dismiss)
   - ‚úÖ Enter current password: `TorsorTeam2025!`
   - ‚úÖ Enter new password (must meet requirements)
   - ‚úÖ Confirm new password
   - ‚úÖ Click "Change Password"
   - ‚úÖ Success message ‚Üí Modal closes
   - ‚úÖ Banner disappears
   - ‚úÖ Full dashboard access

### Test with Other Team Members:

Repeat the same flow for:
- Edward (Assistant Manager)
- Azalia (Assistant Manager)
- Lambros (Senior)
- Jack (Junior)

## üìã STEP 7: Send Credentials to Team Members

### Email Template:

**Subject:** Your Torsor Skills Portal Access

Hi [NAME],

**Login URL:** https://torsor.co.uk/auth
**Email:** [THEIR_EMAIL]@ivcaccounting.co.uk
**Temporary Password:** TorsorTeam2025!

**Important:** You'll be prompted to change your password on first login for security. Please create a strong password containing:
- At least 8 characters
- One uppercase letter
- One lowercase letter
- One number
- One special character (!@#$%^&*)

Once logged in, you'll have access to:
- ‚úÖ Your Skills Heatmap
- ‚úÖ CPD Tracking
- ‚úÖ Learning & Development Resources
- ‚úÖ Mentoring Hub
- ‚úÖ VARK & Personality Assessments

If you have any issues logging in, please contact [ADMIN_EMAIL].

Best regards,
[YOUR_NAME]

## üìã Password Requirements

All new passwords must include:
- ‚úÖ At least **8 characters**
- ‚úÖ One **UPPERCASE** letter
- ‚úÖ One **lowercase** letter
- ‚úÖ One **number** (0-9)
- ‚úÖ One **special character** (!@#$%^&*)

**Password Strength Meter:**
- üî¥ **Weak** (< 40% score)
- üü† **Fair** (40-69% score)
- üü° **Good** (70-89% score)
- üü¢ **Strong** (90%+ score)

---

## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: User can't login
- ‚úÖ Check user exists in Supabase Auth
- ‚úÖ Check email is confirmed
- ‚úÖ Check password is correct (`TorsorTeam2025!`)
- ‚úÖ Clear browser cache and cookies

### Issue: User redirected to admin dashboard
- ‚úÖ Check routing fix is deployed (should go to `/team-member`)
- ‚úÖ Check user role is not 'owner', 'admin', 'partner', or 'director'
- ‚úÖ Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Issue: Password change modal doesn't appear
- ‚úÖ Check `password_change_required = true` in database
- ‚úÖ Check `checkPasswordChangeRequired()` function is running
- ‚úÖ Check user_id is correctly linked

### Issue: Password change fails
- ‚úÖ Check new password meets all requirements
- ‚úÖ Check `mark_password_changed()` function exists
- ‚úÖ Check Supabase logs for errors

## üìä Quick Status Check

**Run this to see overall progress:**

```sql
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN pm.user_id IS NOT NULL THEN 'Has Auth Account'
    ELSE 'Needs Auth Account'
  END AS account_status,
  COUNT(*) AS count
FROM practice_members pm
WHERE pm.practice_id = (SELECT id FROM practices WHERE name = 'Torsor' LIMIT 1)
  AND pm.is_active = true
GROUP BY account_status;
```

**Target:** All 16 team members should have auth accounts!

---

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

‚úÖ All 16 team members can login with standard password
‚úÖ All users see password change banner on first login
‚úÖ Password change is mandatory (modal cannot be dismissed)

## üìû SUPPORT

If any team members have issues, collect:
1. Their email address
2. Error message (screenshot if possible)
3. Browser console logs (F12 ‚Üí Console)
4. What step they're stuck on

Then check:
- Supabase auth logs
- practice_members.user_id is correctly linked
- password_change_required flag status
