# ✅ FIXED: Service Readiness Skill Mapping

## The Problem

The service readiness calculations were showing **0% and "Significant Gaps"** because:

**The skill names in the code didn't match the skill names in your database.**

### Example Mismatches:
- ❌ Code looked for: `"Budgeting & Forecasting"`
- ✅ Database has: `"Budget Preparation"` and `"Financial Modelling & Forecasting"`

- ❌ Code looked for: `"Financial Analysis"`
- ✅ Database has: `"Variance Commentary"` and other specific skills

- ❌ Code looked for: `"System Implementation & Change Management"`
- ✅ Database has: `"Accounting System Selection"`, `"Workflow Optimisation"`

## The Fix

I've updated **all 10 service definitions** to use the **exact skill names** from your database:
