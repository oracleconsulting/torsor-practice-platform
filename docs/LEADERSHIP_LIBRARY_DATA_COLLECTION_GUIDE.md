## ðŸŽ¯ KEY IDENTIFIERS FOR CPD ALLOCATION

The system will match books to individuals based on:

### **1. SKILL GAP MATCHING**
- `skill_tags` â†’ Matches against skill assessment gaps
- Priority: Skills with largest gap between current and required level

### **2. INTEREST ALIGNMENT**
- `skill_tags` + `leadership_competencies` â†’ Matches against high-interest areas
- Books recommended for skills someone wants to develop (even if already proficient)

### **3. ROLE APPROPRIATENESS**
- `recommended_for_roles` â†’ Filters by user's current role
- `difficulty_level` + `prerequisite_knowledge` â†’ Ensures appropriate challenge level

### **4. SCENARIO MATCHING**
- `best_for_scenarios` â†’ Matches to current challenges or goals
- Example: If setting goal "build high-performing team" â†’ recommend relevant books

### **5. LEARNING PATHWAY BUILDING**
- `prerequisite_knowledge` + `related_books` â†’ Creates progression
- `difficulty_level` â†’ Orders from beginner to advanced

### **6. CPD HOUR PLANNING**
- `cpd_hours_value` â†’ Helps plan annual CPD requirements
- `estimated_read_time_hours` â†’ Fits into available time

### **7. LEARNING STYLE MATCHING** (Future: VARK Integration)
- `practical_exercises` = TRUE â†’ Kinesthetic learners
- `case_studies_examples` = TRUE â†’ Reading/Writing learners
- Framework/model-heavy â†’ Visual learners

---

## ðŸ“Š EXAMPLE: How CPD Matching Works

**User Profile:**
- Role: Manager
- Skills Gap: "Conflict Resolution" (Current: 2, Required: 4, Interest: 5)
- Current Goal: "Improve team dynamics"
- Available time: 2 hours/week
- Learning style: Kinesthetic (likes exercises)

**System Logic:**
1. Searches `skill_tags` for "Conflict Resolution"
2. Filters `recommended_for_roles` for "Manager"
3. Matches `best_for_scenarios` for "team dynamics" or "team conflict"
4. Prefers books with `practical_exercises` = TRUE
5. Orders by `difficulty_level` appropriate for current skill level
6. Checks `cpd_hours_value` fits into weekly time budget

**Result:** Recommends "Crucial Conversations" or "Difficult Conversations" with clear rationale:
> "Recommended because: Addresses your Conflict Resolution gap (Current: 2 â†’ Target: 4) | Aligned with your goal: Improve team dynamics | Appropriate for your Manager role | Includes practical exercises (matches your learning style) | 12 CPD hours (~6 weeks at 2 hours/week)"

## ðŸš€ GETTING STARTED

1. **Upload book covers** to `/public/images/leadership-library/` with consistent naming
2. **Process 3-5 books** with the AI prompt to validate the structure
3. **Review and refine** the data format based on what works
4. **Batch process** the remaining 25 books
5. **Import CSV** into the system

The more detailed and accurate your data, the better the CPD recommendations will be!
