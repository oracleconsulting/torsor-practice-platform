## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Phase 1: Database Setup (5 minutes)
- [ ] Run SQL to add `password_change_required` and `last_password_change` columns
- [ ] Create helper functions (`check_password_change_required`, `mark_password_changed`)
- [ ] Run verification query to see who needs auth accounts

### Phase 2: Create Auth Accounts (15-20 minutes)
For each team member without an account:
- [ ] Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users → Add User
- [ ] Email: `[name]@ivcaccounting.co.uk`
- [ ] Password: `TorsorTeam2025!`
- [ ] Auto-confirm email: ✅ YES
- [ ] Copy user_id

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Get Actual Email Addresses from Database**

Run this query to get the real team member emails:

```sql
SELECT name, email, role
FROM practice_members
WHERE practice_id = (SELECT id FROM practices WHERE name = 'Torsor' LIMIT 1)
  AND is_active = true
  AND user_id IS NULL  -- Only show those without auth accounts
ORDER BY name;
```

**Use the email addresses from the `email` column above!**
Do NOT use hardcoded `@ivcaccounting.co.uk` addresses.

### Phase 3: Link Accounts (10 minutes)
For each created account:
- [ ] Run UPDATE query to link user_id to practice_members
- [ ] Set `password_change_required = true`
- [ ] Verify link with SELECT query

### Phase 4: Testing (10 minutes)
Test login flow with at least 3 team members:
- [ ] **Any Assistant Manager** - `/team-member` portal (use actual email from database)
- [ ] **Any Senior** - `/team-member` portal (use actual email from database)
- [ ] **Any Junior** - `/team-member` portal (use actual email from database)

**Expected Flow:**
1. Login with `TorsorTeam2025!`
2. Redirected to `/team-member` (NOT admin dashboard)
3. Orange banner appears: "Password Change Required"
4. Modal auto-opens (mandatory)
5. Change password (must meet requirements)
6. Success → Banner disappears
7. Full dashboard access

### Phase 5: Send Credentials (5 minutes)
- [ ] Copy email template from setup guide
- [ ] Customize with team member name and email
- [ ] Send to all 15 team members
- [ ] Track who has received credentials

## 🔍 Quick Verification Queries

### Check Who Needs Auth Accounts
```sql
SELECT 
  pm.name,
  pm.email,
  pm.role,
  CASE 
    WHEN pm.user_id IS NOT NULL THEN '✅ Has Account'
    ELSE '❌ Needs Account'
  END AS status
FROM practice_members pm
WHERE pm.practice_id = (SELECT id FROM practices WHERE name = 'Torsor' LIMIT 1)
  AND pm.is_active = true
ORDER BY status, pm.name;
```

### Verify All Accounts Linked
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE user_id IS NOT NULL) AS accounts_linked,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE user_id IS NULL) AS accounts_missing,
  COUNT(*) AS total
FROM practice_members
WHERE practice_id = (SELECT id FROM practices WHERE name = 'Torsor' LIMIT 1)
  AND is_active = true;
```

**Target:** `accounts_linked = 16`, `accounts_missing = 0`
