# 🔍 Isolating the Problem - v1.0.6 (23:10)

## 🚨 **Current Situation**

### What Happened:
- v1.0.4: Removed TeamMetrics JSX → **Error persisted** ❌
- v1.0.5: Removed TeamMetrics import → **Error STILL persisted** ❌
- **Conclusion**: The problem is NOT TeamMetrics!

### The Error:
```
React error #310 at L7 (AdvisorySkillsPage)
"Hooks can only be called inside the body of a function component"
```

This means **somewhere** a hook (useState, useEffect, etc.) is being called incorrectly.

---

## 🎯 **The Test - v1.0.6**

### What We're Doing:
**Disabling ALL components except SkillsMatrix** to identify the culprit.

### Components Disabled:
- ❌ SkillsAssessment (commented out import + JSX)
- ❌ GapAnalysis (commented out import + JSX)
- ❌ DevelopmentPlanning (commented out import + JSX)
- ❌ TeamMetrics (already disabled)

### Components Enabled:
- ✅ SkillsMatrix (only working component)
- ✅ Skills Analysis tab (just card + text, no complex components)

### Visible Tabs:
- Skills Matrix
- Skills Analysis

---

## 🔬 **Diagnostic Logic**

### Scenario 1: Error GONE ✅
**If v1.0.6 works without errors:**
- The problem is in one of the disabled components
- We'll re-enable them one by one to find the culprit:
  1. Enable SkillsAssessment → test
  2. Enable GapAnalysis → test
  3. Enable DevelopmentPlanning → test
- Whichever one breaks it is the problem!

### Scenario 2: Error PERSISTS ❌
**If v1.0.6 STILL shows the error:**
- The problem is in `AdvisorySkillsPage` itself OR `SkillsMatrix`
- We'll need to review hook usage in these files
- Possible causes:
  - Hook called conditionally
  - Hook called in a loop
  - Hook called in a callback
  - Hook called outside component function

## ⏳ **What to Expect**

### Timeline:
- **23:10**: Code pushed
- **23:15-23:20**: Railway builds
- **Your action**: Wait for deployment, then hard refresh

### After Deployment + Hard Refresh:

#### Success Criteria:
```
Console shows:
🎯 Advisory Skills Page - Build Version: 1.0.6-isolate-problem-component
✅ Loaded real data: 2 members, 110 skills
NO React error #310 ← This would be great!
```

#### What You'll See:
- Only 2 tabs: "Skills Matrix" and "Skills Analysis"
- Skills Matrix should show Luke + Jaanu's data
- Skills Analysis should show mentoring opportunities
- All other tabs hidden (temporarily)

---

## 🚀 **How to Test**

### Step 1: Wait for Deployment
Run the monitoring script:
```bash
cd /Users/James.Howard/Documents/OracleConsultingAI/torsor-practice-platform
bash wait-for-deploy.sh
```

Or wait 5-10 minutes manually.

### Step 2: Hard Refresh
```
Cmd + Shift + R
```

### Step 3: Check Console
Look for:
- ✅ "Build Version: 1.0.6-isolate-problem-component"
- ❌ NO "React error #310" ← Success!
- OR
- ❌ Still seeing "React error #310" ← Need deeper investigation

### Step 4: Report Back
Tell me:
1. Do you see the error or not?
2. What's the bundle hash?
3. What's in the console?

## 📊 **Deployment Attempts Log**

| Time | Version | Action | Result |
|------|---------|--------|--------|
| 22:48 | v1.0.4 | Added BUILD_VERSION | New bundle, error persisted |
| 23:00 | v1.0.5 | Removed TeamMetrics import | Error persisted |
| **23:10** | **v1.0.6** | **Minimal config test** | ⏳ **Testing now** |

---

## 🎯 **What This Tells Us**

### If It Works:
We know the problem is in one of:
- SkillsAssessment
- GapAnalysis  
- DevelopmentPlanning

We'll re-enable them one by one to pinpoint it.

### If It Doesn't Work:
We know the problem is in:
- AdvisorySkillsPage itself
- SkillsMatrix
- Or the way we're setting up the page

We'll review hook usage in these files.

---

## 💡 **Why This Approach**

### Binary Search Method:
Instead of guessing, we're systematically eliminating possibilities:
1. Disable everything → Does it work?
2. If yes → Re-enable one thing at a time
3. If no → Problem is in what's left
4. Eventually we find the exact cause!

This is faster than randomly trying fixes.

## 📝 **Technical Notes**

### React Error #310:
"Hooks can only be called inside the body of a function component."

Common causes:
1. Hook at module level (outside component)
2. Hook in a class component
3. Hook in a non-React function
4. Hook inside a condition/loop
5. Multiple React versions (we only have one)

We've checked #1 manually - all imports looked fine. So it's likely #3 or #4.

---

## 🆘 **Next Steps Based on Results**

### If v1.0.6 Works:
1. You confirm: "No error! Only 2 tabs visible."
2. I push v1.0.7 with SkillsAssessment re-enabled
3. Test again
4. Repeat until we find the culprit
5. Fix that specific component

### If v1.0.6 STILL Errors:
1. You share console screenshot
2. I'll review AdvisorySkillsPage hook usage line by line
3. Check if SkillsMatrix has issues
4. Might need to check Chart.js registration
5. Last resort: Use non-minified React for detailed error

**Current Time**: 23:10  
**Expected Live**: 23:15-23:20  
**Your Action**: Wait for deployment + hard refresh + report back  
**Goal**: Identify the exact component causing React error #310

**This systematic approach WILL find the problem!** 🔍✨
