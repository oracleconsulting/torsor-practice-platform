## üîç 2. CLIENT OUTREACH - Enhanced Features

### 2.1 Date Range Comparison

**Purpose:** Track client registrations at accounting firms over time to identify:
- Firms that have **left** an accountant (potential clients available)
- Firms that have **joined** an accountant (potential acquisition targets)
- **Stable** client base at competing firms

**Features:**
- Compare two date ranges side-by-side
- Visual indicators for new firms (green), left firms (red), unchanged (blue)
- Export comparison results for analysis
- Automatic saving to search history

**Use Cases:**
1. **Track Acquisitions** - See which firms are acquiring clients
2. **Find Available Clients** - Identify firms that left their accountant
3. **Market Analysis** - Understand client movement patterns
4. **Competitive Intelligence** - Monitor competitor client bases

**Component:** `DateRangeComparison.tsx`

### 2.2 Search History

**Purpose:** Save and recall previous searches for efficiency and pattern tracking

**Features:**
- Automatic saving of all searches (address matches, date ranges, comparisons)
- View last 50 searches with timestamps
- One-click reload of previous searches
- Delete unwanted history items
- Shows search type and results count

**Database Table:** `outreach_search_history`
- Stores search parameters
- Practice-level access control
- RLS policies for security

**Component:** `SearchHistoryPanel.tsx`
**Migration:** `20250105_outreach_search_history.sql`

### 2.3 Enhanced Export with ALL Fields

**Purpose:** Export comprehensive company data including ALL publicly available information

**Features:**
- Export all Companies House data fields
- Include officers, filing history, charges, PSC data
- Optional LLM-verified addresses
- CSV and JSON formats
- Batch export support

**Service Methods:**
```typescript
comprehensiveExportWithAllFields(address, includeLLMVerification)
```

### 2.4 LLM Address Verification

**Purpose:** Use AI (GPT-5/Perplexity) to verify real trading and contact addresses (not just registered offices)

**Why This Matters:**
- Registered offices are often accountants' offices (can't reach out there!)
- Need actual trading addresses for outreach
- AI can search public records, websites, and directories
- Saves hours of manual research

**Features:**
- **Single verification** - Verify one company at a time
- **Batch verification** - Process multiple companies automatically
- **Confidence scoring** - AI rates accuracy of found addresses
- **Source tracking** - Shows where information was found
- **Progress tracking** - Real-time updates during batch processing

**Results Include:**
- Trading address (where they actually do business)
- Contact address (where to send mail)
- Confidence score (0-100%)
- Sources used (website, directories, public records)
- Notes from AI analysis

**Component:** `LLMAddressVerification.tsx`

**Service Methods:**
```typescript
verifyAddressWithLLM(companyData)        // Single company
batchVerifyAddresses(companies)          // Multiple companies
```

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Changes

### New Table: `outreach_search_history`

```sql
CREATE TABLE outreach_search_history (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  practice_id UUID,
  search_type TEXT,              -- 'address_match', 'date_range', 'date_comparison'
  address TEXT,
  date_range JSONB,
  date_ranges JSONB,
  results_count INTEGER,
  filters JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Indexes:**
- `idx_search_history_practice` - Fast practice lookups
- `idx_search_history_created` - Sort by date
- `idx_search_history_type` - Filter by search type

**Security:**
- Row-Level Security enabled
- Users can only access their practice's history
- Automatic cleanup via CASCADE delete

## üîå API Integration Required

The frontend is ready, but the **backend API endpoints** need to be implemented in `oracle_api_server`:

### Required Endpoints

```
POST /api/outreach/enhanced-search/address-date-range
  - Search companies at address within date range
  
POST /api/outreach/enhanced-search/compare-date-ranges
  - Compare two date ranges to find differences
  
POST /api/outreach/llm-verify-address
  - Single company address verification via LLM
  
POST /api/outreach/llm-verify-addresses-batch
  - Batch address verification
  
POST /api/outreach/enhanced-search/export-all-fields
  - Comprehensive export with all available data
```

### LLM Integration Notes
- Use **GPT-5** (OpenAI) or **Perplexity** API
- Search web for company trading addresses
- Check company websites, Google Maps, business directories
- Return structured JSON with addresses and confidence scores
- Rate limit to avoid excessive API costs

---

## üìù Technical Notes

### Dependencies Added
- `date-fns` - For date formatting in search history
- Existing: React, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui

### Environment Variables (Backend)
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=xxx           # For GPT-5 address verification
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=xxx       # Alternative LLM option
COMPANIES_HOUSE_API_KEY=xxx  # Already exists
```

### Performance Considerations
- Search history limited to 50 recent searches
- LLM verification uses batch processing for efficiency
- Progress tracking for long-running batch operations
- Exports use streaming for large datasets
