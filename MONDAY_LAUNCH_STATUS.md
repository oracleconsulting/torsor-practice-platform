# 🚀 Monday Launch Status - TORSOR Skills Portal

## ✅ **WORKING NOW (Critical for Launch)**

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Login System** - Admin can log in as jhoward@rpgcc.co.uk
- ✅ **Dashboard** - Loads without "Setting up practice" loop
- ✅ **Database Connection** - Supabase connected, data loading
- ✅ **Real Data Loading** - 110 skills + assessments from database
- ✅ **Team Invitations** - Can send invitation emails via Resend
- ✅ **Public Assessment** - Team members can complete assessment without login
- ✅ **Data Saving** - Assessment data saves to database
- ✅ **Skills Matrix** - Shows real assessment data with heatmap
- ✅ **Gap Analysis** - Shows critical gaps from real data

## 🟡 **UI POLISH NEEDED (Non-Critical)**

### 1. Heatmap Layout - Compressed/Unreadable
**Issue:** Skill names compressed in heatmap view  
**Impact:** Low - data is there, just hard to read  
**Fix:** Increase column widths, add tooltips  
**Priority:** Medium

### 2. Assessment Page Display
**Issue:** Assessment tab not showing "full completion"  
**Impact:** Low - assessment WAS completed and saved  
**Fix:** Update UI to show 100% completion status  
**Priority:** Low

### 3. Create Plan Buttons
**Issue:** "Create Plan" buttons in Gap Analysis don't work  
**Impact:** Low - buttons are future feature placeholders  
**Fix:** Either hide buttons or implement basic functionality  
**Priority:** Low

### 4. CPD Tab Mock Data
**Issue:** CPD Tracker tab shows hardcoded mock data  
**Impact:** Medium - confusing if not using CPD feature yet  
**Fix:** Either hide tab or connect to real data  
**Priority:** Medium

### 5. Team Metrics Verification
**Issue:** Need to verify Team Metrics uses real data  
**Impact:** Low - metrics appear to be calculating correctly  
**Fix:** Review code to confirm all metrics from database  
**Priority:** Low

## 🎯 **LAUNCH READINESS**

### Can You Launch Monday? **YES, with caveats:**

**✅ CORE WORKFLOW WORKS:**
1. Admin sends invitation
2. Team member clicks link → goes to assessment
3. Team member completes 110-skill assessment
4. Data saves to database
5. Admin can view assessment data in Skills Matrix
6. Admin can see gaps, interest levels, and metrics

**⚠️ MINOR ISSUES:**
- Some UI elements are compressed/hard to read
- Some features are placeholders (CPD, Create Plan buttons)
- Some polish needed on layout

**Recommendation:** 
- ✅ **Launch Monday** - core functionality works
- 🛠️ **Fix polish issues** over the first week
- 📝 **Tell team members** some features are "coming soon"
