## 🚀 **WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW**

### Step 1: Hard Refresh Your Browser
**On Mac Chrome:**
```
Cmd + Shift + R
```

**Or:**
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Click **"Empty Cache and Hard Reload"**

### Step 2: Verify It Worked
After refreshing, check your browser console for:
```
🎯 Advisory Skills Page - Build Version: 1.0.4-fix-react-error-310
```

If you see this message, **the new code is running!** ✅

### Step 3: Test Advisory Skills Page
1. Navigate to **Team Management** → **Advisory Skills**
2. The page should load WITHOUT errors
3. You should see Luke and Jaanu's assessment data
4. 5 tabs should be visible (Team Metrics temporarily hidden)

---

## 📊 **What Changed**

### The Fix:
- **Team Metrics tab disabled** (workaround for React error #310)
- **Added BUILD_VERSION constant** to force new bundle
- **Database cleaned** - only 2 real members remain
- **Direct Supabase access** enabled for faster debugging

### Why Previous Deploys Failed:
- Vite uses content-based hashing
- Code comments didn't change the actual code
- Same code = same hash = no real deployment
- **Solution**: Added executable code (BUILD_VERSION + console.log)

---

## ✅ **Expected Results**

### Console Output:
```
🎯 Advisory Skills Page - Build Version: 1.0.4-fix-react-error-310
✅ Loaded real data: 2 members, 110 skills
Found 110 skills in database
Found 220 skill assessments from database
```

### NO Errors:
- ❌ No "Minified React error #310"
- ❌ No "Something went wrong"
- ❌ No ErrorBoundary messages

### Working Features:
- ✅ Skills Matrix tab
- ✅ Assessment tab
- ✅ Gap Analysis tab
- ✅ Development Planning tab
- ✅ Skills Analysis tab
- ⏸️ Team Metrics tab (temporarily hidden)

## 🔍 **Verification Checklist**

After hard refresh, verify:

- [ ] New bundle hash in Network tab (`index-7cbda6a4.js`)
- [ ] Build version message in console (`1.0.4-fix-react-error-310`)
- [ ] "2 members" in console (not 3)
- [ ] Advisory Skills page loads
- [ ] No React errors in console
- [ ] Can view Luke and Jaanu's skill data

## 🆘 **If It Still Doesn't Work**

### If you STILL see `index-8648972c.js`:
1. Try **Incognito/Private Window**
2. Try **different browser** (Safari, Firefox)
3. Check browser cache settings
4. Try clearing ALL browser data for the site

### If you see NEW hash but STILL get errors:
1. Take a screenshot of the console
2. Share it with me
3. We'll investigate the new error together

## 📈 **What's Next**

Once this is working, we have 4 remaining TODOs:

1. **Make interest level mandatory** in assessment
2. **Add DataRails** to software questions (Fathom group)
3. **Enable going back** to previous questions in assessment
4. **Add purpose explanation** to invitation email

We can tackle these once you confirm Advisory Skills is loading! 🚀
