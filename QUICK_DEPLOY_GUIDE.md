## 🚀 Deploy in 3 Steps

### **STEP 1: Apply Database Migration** (5 minutes)

#### Option A: Manual (Recommended)

1. **Open your Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project

2. **Navigate to SQL Editor:**
   - Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Click "+ New Query"

3. **Copy & Paste the Migration:**
   - Open: `supabase/migrations/20251021_personality_assessments.sql`
   - Copy the entire file (432 lines)
   - Paste into the SQL Editor

4. **Run the Migration:**
   - Click "Run" or press `Cmd+Enter` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows)
   - Wait for confirmation: "Success. No rows returned"

5. **Verify Success:**
   Run this query:
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
   WHERE table_schema = 'public'
   AND table_name IN ('personality_assessments', 'team_member_profiles', 'team_compositions');
   ```
   You should see 3 tables returned.

#### Option B: Using the Helper Script

```bash
cd torsor-practice-platform
./apply-ocean-migration.sh

This script will guide you through the process.
