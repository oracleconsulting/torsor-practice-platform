## The Intelligence Behind It

### Cross-Assessment Correlations

**Personality × Performance:**
- High Conscientiousness + High Openness = Fast learner
- High Conscientiousness + High skill level = High performer

**Learning Style × Training Effectiveness:**
- Kinesthetic learners → Hands-on training = Faster skill development
- Visual learners → Video tutorials = Better retention

**EQ × Conflict Style:**
- High Empathy + Collaborating style = Ideal mediator
- High Social Skills + Client-facing role = Client satisfaction

**Belbin × Motivation:**
- Shaper + Achievement motivation = Natural fit
- Team Worker + Affiliation motivation = Team harmony
- Mismatched combinations get flagged

### Predictive Algorithms

**Retention Risk Formula:**
```
Risk = Motivation Mismatch (30%) +
       Low Role Fit (25%) +
       Low Autonomy (20%) +
       No Development (15%) +
       Workload Issues (10%)
```

Example: High-achiever in junior role with low autonomy = **HIGH FLIGHT RISK**

**Burnout Risk Formula:**
```
Risk = High Neuroticism (35%) +
       High Workload (25%) +
       Poor Work-Life Balance (20%) +
       Low Support (10%) +
       Low Control (10%)
```

Example: Anxious personality + 60-hour weeks + no flexibility = **HIGH BURNOUT RISK**

**Promotion Readiness Formula:**
```
Readiness = Technical Skills (40%) +
            Leadership Potential (35%) +
            Emotional Intelligence (25%)
```

Example: Skill level 4.0 + High EQ + Extravert = **PROMOTION READY**
