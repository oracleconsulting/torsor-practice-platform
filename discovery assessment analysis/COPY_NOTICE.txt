COPY NOTICE — Discovery Assessment Analysis Folder
================================================================================
Last updated: 2026-02-07

EVERY .ts, .tsx, .sql file in this folder is a REFERENCE COPY of the live
codebase. Do NOT edit these files when making changes to the product.

- Edit the LIVE files in torsor-practice-platform/ (paths listed in
  DISCOVERY_SYSTEM_LIVE_SUMMARY.md and in each file's header).
- This folder is FLAT (no subfolders). It exists so you can read the full
  Discovery system in one place without touching the real code.

Each copy file has a first-line header like:
  /* COPY - Do not edit. Source: supabase/functions/... */
  -- COPY - Do not edit. Source: supabase/migrations/...
  <!-- COPY - Do not edit. Source: ... -->

The folder `torsor-practice-platform/discovery assessment analysis` is a FLAT
reference copy of the live Discovery Assessment system. Every file there is
marked COPY — do not edit those files; edit the corresponding live paths in
`torsor-practice-platform/` instead.

Read `discovery assessment analysis/DISCOVERY_SYSTEM_LIVE_SUMMARY.md` for:
- System overview (Pass 1 / Pass 2 / Pass 3, pin/block, tables)
- Mapping from flat COPY filenames to live paths (supabase/functions,
  supabase/migrations, apps/client-portal, src/components/discovery, etc.)

Admin discovery UI (Create Service modal, pin/block, opportunities) lives in
`src/pages/admin/ClientServicesPage.tsx`. Pass 3 pin/block is implemented in
`supabase/functions/generate-discovery-opportunities/index.ts`.
