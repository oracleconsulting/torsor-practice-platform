YOUR TASK
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Analyze this client against the benchmarks and produce a structured JSON output.

RULES:
1. Compare EVERY available metric (including derived/calculated metrics shown above)
2. Calculate percentile position for each (where client value falls between p25/p50/p75)
3. Quantify the annual £ impact of gaps - BUT READ THE DOUBLE-COUNTING RULES BELOW
4. Use their EXACT WORDS when referencing their concerns
5. Generate actionable admin guidance
6. Flag any data gaps that need collection

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CRITICAL: DO NOT DOUBLE-COUNT OPPORTUNITIES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Revenue per employee is an OUTCOME METRIC - it improves WHEN you fix utilisation, rates, or margins.
It is NOT a separate lever you can pull.

WRONG (double counting):
- Utilisation gap: £184,000
- Rate increase: £82,000  
- Revenue per employee gap: £410,000
- TOTAL: £676,000 ❌ This is fantasy

RIGHT (realistic):
- Utilisation gap: £184,000 (this is the PRIMARY lever)
- Rate increase: £82,000 (independent lever)
- TOTAL REALISTIC OPPORTUNITY: £266,000 ✓

HIERARCHY OF METRICS:
1. INPUT LEVERS (count these): Utilisation rate, Hourly rates, Project margins
2. OUTCOME METRICS (DO NOT add to total): Revenue per employee (this is the RESULT)

REALISTIC OPPORTUNITY CALCULATION:
- Pick the 2-3 most actionable INPUT levers
- Calculate their individual impact on revenue
- Be conservative - assume 50-70% of theoretical gap is capturable
- The totalAnnualOpportunity should be 15-40% of current revenue MAX for most firms
- If your total exceeds 50% of current revenue, you've almost certainly double-counted

PRESENT HONESTLY:
- "Improving utilisation to median could add £X"
- "This would bring revenue per employee closer to the £145K median"
- NOT "£410K from revenue per employee PLUS £184K from utilisation"

The client isn't stupid. Telling a £750K business they're leaving £700K on the table sounds like nonsense.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MINIMUM VIABLE ANALYSIS RULES - CRITICAL
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You MUST produce quantified analysis if ANY of these conditions are met:

### Condition 1: Revenue + Headcount Available
If you have:
- Revenue (from any source: assessment, MA data, or derived)
- Employee count (from any source)

Then you MUST calculate:
- Revenue per employee = revenue ÷ employees (if not already provided)
- Compare to benchmark median
- Calculate gap: (benchmark_median - client_value) × employees = annual opportunity
- NEVER return £0 opportunity when revenue and headcount are available

### Condition 2: Revenue + Any Margin Available
If you have:
- Revenue
- Gross margin OR net margin (as % or absolute)

Then you MUST:
- Calculate margin % if given absolutes
- Compare to benchmark median
- Calculate gap: revenue × (benchmark_margin - client_margin) = annual opportunity

### Condition 3: Client Concentration Available
If you have:
- Top 3 customer % (from HVA: top3_customer_revenue_percentage or derived)

Then you MUST:
- Compare to benchmark median
- Assess concentration risk
- Note in narrative

### NEVER RETURN £0 OPPORTUNITY WHEN:
- Revenue data exists (derive what you can)
- At least 2 data points are available
- HVA provides supplementary metrics

### ALWAYS ACKNOWLEDGE LIMITATIONS:
If data is partial, clearly state:
- Which metrics were calculated vs. provided
- Which metrics could not be assessed
- What additional data would enable fuller analysis

Example GOOD analysis (honest, actionable):
"Your utilisation rate of 57% is 14 points below the 71% industry median. 
Improving to median would add approximately £130,000-£180,000 in billable 
capacity - if you have the work to fill it. Combined with a modest rate 
increase (£85 to £95/hr), the realistic opportunity is £200,000-£250,000 
annually. This would bring your revenue per employee from £93,750 closer 
to the £120,000 mark - not quite median, but a solid improvement."

Example BAD analysis (double-counted nonsense):
"Revenue per employee gap: £410,000. Plus utilisation gap: £184,000. 
Plus rate gap: £82,000. Total: £676,000!" 
❌ This is absurd - you've told a £750K business to nearly double.

THE SMELL TEST: If your total opportunity exceeds 40% of current revenue, 
you've probably made an error. Re-check for double counting.

## HVA CONTEXT DATA

The client has completed a Hidden Value Audit which provides rich qualitative context. 
Use this data to:
1. Ground your narrative in their specific situation
2. Validate/challenge their self-perceptions with benchmark data
3. Quote their exact words when describing concerns or goals
4. Address their stated fears directly in the executive summary

### Founder Risk Assessment
${founderRiskSection}

### Succession Readiness
${successionSection}

### Client Quotes
${quotesSection}

### Additional HVA Metrics
${hvaMetricsText || 'No additional metrics available'}

## NARRATIVE REQUIREMENTS

When writing narratives:
1. If client stated a fear (e.g., "we're busy but not efficient"), ADDRESS IT DIRECTLY with benchmark evidence
2. If client identified a gap (e.g., "we undercharge"), VALIDATE OR CHALLENGE with data
3. Reference specific HVA percentages (e.g., "with ${founderRisk.riskFactors.find((f: any) => f.hvaField === 'knowledge_dependency_percentage')?.hvaValue || 'X'}% of knowledge concentrated in the founder...")
4. Use verbatim quotes where they add authenticity (e.g., "As you noted, 'we still rely on founder-led sales'")
5. Connect benchmark gaps to founder risk factors where relevant
