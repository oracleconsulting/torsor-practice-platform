# Skills Analysis Tab - Internal Mentoring & CPD

## 🎯 Purpose

The Skills Analysis tab enables you to **leverage internal capacity** for team development by identifying:
- **Experts** who can share their knowledge
- **Eager learners** who want to develop specific skills

This allows you to run internal CPD sessions and mentoring programs in small groups, reducing external training costs while building team cohesion.

## 📊 How It Works

### For Each Skill (All 110 Skills):

#### **Top 5 Performers** (Experts)
- Shows team members with **Level 3+** (Competent or higher)
- Sorted by skill level (highest first)
- These are your internal experts who can mentor

**Displayed Info:**
- Name
- Current skill level (Green badge)
- Role

#### **High Interest Learners**
- Shows team members with:
  - **Low skill** (Level ≤ 2)
  - **High interest** (Interest ≥ 4)
- Sorted by interest level (highest first)
- These are eager learners who want to develop

**Displayed Info:**
- Name
- Current skill level (Amber badge)
- Interest level (Blue badge)

### **Mentoring Opportunity Alert**

When a skill has BOTH experts AND learners, a green alert appears:

> **Mentoring Opportunity:** X expert(s) can mentor Y eager learner(s) in small groups

## 💡 Use Cases

### 1. **Internal Mentoring Programs**

**Scenario:** You need to upskill junior staff in "Three-Way Forecasting"

**Steps:**
1. Go to Advisory Skills → Skills Analysis
2. Find "Three-Way Forecasting"
3. See:
   - **Top Performers**: Sarah (Level 5), John (Level 4)
   - **Learners**: Emma (Level 1, Interest 5), Mark (Level 2, Interest 4)
4. **Action**: Organize 2-hour workshop where Sarah/John teach Emma/Mark

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No external training cost
- ✅ Tailored to your practice's specific needs
- ✅ Builds team relationships
- ✅ Knowledge stays within the firm

### 2. **Small Group CPD Sessions**

Instead of sending individuals to external courses:
- Identify 1-2 experts in a skill
- Find 3-5 eager learners
- Run internal 1-hour sessions monthly
- Use real client examples (anonymized)

### 3. **Succession Planning**

For skills with only 1 expert (succession risk):
- Identify that expert
- Find interested learners
- Create knowledge transfer program
- Document processes as you go

### 4. **Cost-Effective Development**

**Example Cost Comparison:**

| Method | Cost | Time |
|--------|------|------|
| External course (5 people × £500) | £2,500 | 2 days each |
| Internal mentoring (expert time 4 hours) | £200* | 4 hours total |
| **Savings** | **£2,300** | **More flexible** |

*Assuming £50/hour for expert's time

## 🔍 Filtering Logic

### Top Performers Criteria:
```
- Current Level >= 3 (Competent or higher)
- Sorted by level (highest first)
- Limited to top 5
```

### High Interest Learners Criteria:
```
- Current Level <= 2 (Beginner/Basic)
- Interest Level >= 4 (High/Very High)
- Sorted by interest (highest first)
- Limited to top 5
```

### Why These Thresholds?

**Level 3+ for experts:**
- Ensures they're competent to teach
- Confident in the skill
- Can answer questions

**Level ≤2 with Interest ≥4:**
- Identifies genuine learners
- Not just "nice to have" interest
- Low skill = greatest potential for improvement
- High interest = motivated to learn
