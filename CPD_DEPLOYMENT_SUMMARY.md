# CPD System Deployment Summary

## 🎉 What's Been Deployed

### ✅ Phase 1: Complete (Just Deployed)

#### 1. **Database Schema** (`20251009_cpd_system.sql`)
- **5 new tables** created in Supabase:
  - `cpd_activities` - Track all CPD activities
  - `cpd_external_resources` - External training/course library  
  - `knowledge_documents` - Team knowledge base
  - `cpd_requirements` - Role-based annual CPD hour targets
  - `development_plan_cpd` - Link CPD to development plans

#### 2. **Skills Matrix Enhancements**
- ✅ Color legend added (0-5 skill levels with descriptions)
- ✅ Clear visual guide for skill level interpretation

#### 3. **Team Metrics Cleanup**
- ✅ Removed all mock/hardcoded data
- ✅ Fixed cramped succession risk layout
- ✅ Added development resources cards

#### 4. **Documentation**
- ✅ `SKILLS_PRIORITY_ALGORITHM.md` - Complete algorithm documentation
- ✅ Priority formula: **Gap × Interest × Business Criticality**

## 🔄 Phase 2: In Progress

### **CPD Tracker Modernization**

**What Needs to Happen:**
1. ✅ Database schema created (DONE)
2. 🔄 **Next**: Connect CPD Tracker UI to real database
3. 🔄 Add file upload for certificates
4. 🔄 Add knowledge document upload
5. 🔄 Link external CPD resources to development plans

**Current State:**
- CPD Tracker page exists with mock data
- Needs complete rewrite to use new `cpd_activities` table
- Need to add upload functionality for:
  - Certificates (PDF uploads)
  - Knowledge summaries (team-shared learning)

## 📋 What the User Needs to Do

### **CRITICAL: Run the SQL Migration**

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to your RPGCC/TORSOR Supabase project
   - Navigate to **SQL Editor**

2. **Run the Migration**
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste the contents of:
   -- supabase/migrations/20251009_cpd_system.sql
   -- into the SQL Editor and execute
   ```

3. **Verify Tables Created**
   ```sql
   -- Check tables exist:
   SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables 
   WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
   AND tablename LIKE 'cpd%' OR tablename LIKE 'knowledge%';
   
   -- Should show:
   -- cpd_activities
   -- cpd_external_resources
   -- cpd_requirements
   -- knowledge_documents
   -- development_plan_cpd
   ```

4. **Check Sample Data**
   ```sql
   -- View sample CPD requirements (should show ACCA standards):
   SELECT * FROM public.cpd_requirements;
   
   -- View sample external resources:
   SELECT * FROM public.cpd_external_resources;
   ```

## 📝 Priority Algorithm

**Formula:**
```
Priority Score = Skill Gap × Interest Level
```

**Priority Bands:**
- 15-25: **Critical** - Immediate training required
- 10-14: **High** - Plan within next quarter
- 5-9: **Medium** - Include in annual plan
- 1-4: **Low** - When resources available
- 0: **None** - No action needed

**Example:**
- Gap of 3 (Required: 5, Current: 2)
- Interest of 5 (Very High)
- **Priority = 15 (CRITICAL)**

## 🎨 UI Updates

### **Skills Matrix:**
- 🟥 **Red (1-2)**: Beginner/Basic
- 🟨 **Amber (3)**: Competent
- 🟩 **Emerald (4-5)**: Proficient/Expert
