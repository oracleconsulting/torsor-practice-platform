-- =====================================================
-- WHICH OPTION SHOULD YOU USE?
-- =====================================================
--
-- üéØ MOST LIKELY: Use OPTION 1
-- - You probably did the test assessment as jhoward@rpgcc.co.uk
-- - This is your admin email that you're about to change to BSGBD@rpgcc.co.uk
-- - Deleting this lets you re-do the assessment with your proper email later
--
-- ü§î IF UNSURE: Run the VERIFICATION queries first
-- - See which email(s) have assessment data
-- - Then uncomment the appropriate option above
--
-- üßπ NUCLEAR OPTION: Use OPTION 3 (uncomment it)
-- - Deletes ALL test assessment data for both emails
-- - Clean slate to start fresh
-- - Safest if you're not sure what you did
--
-- =====================================================
-- WORKFLOW AFTER DELETION
-- =====================================================
--
-- After deleting your test assessment data:
--
-- 1. Run CHANGE_ADMIN_EMAIL.sql to change admin email to BSGBD@rpgcc.co.uk
-- 2. Sign out and sign back in with new admin email (BSGBD@rpgcc.co.uk)
-- 3. Go to Team Invitations
-- 4. Create invitation for jhoward@rpgcc.co.uk (your real email)
-- 5. Complete the assessment properly as a team member
-- 6. Your data will show in Skills Matrix correctly!
--
-- This way:
-- ‚úÖ Admin account = BSGBD@rpgcc.co.uk (oversight/management)
-- ‚úÖ Team member = jhoward@rpgcc.co.uk (your skills assessment)
-- ‚úÖ No conflicts or duplicate data
