3. What's your ideal work environment? (Open office, quiet room, home, coffee shop)
4. How do you prefer to communicate? (Face-to-face, video call, phone, email, Slack)
5. When starting a project, do you prefer a detailed plan or flexibility to pivot?
6. Do you prefer to work on one task deeply or multitask across several?
7. How much autonomy do you want? (Check-in daily, weekly, monthly, trust-based)
8. Do you prefer collaborative work or independent work?
9. How do you handle deadlines? (Start early, steady progress, last-minute sprint)
