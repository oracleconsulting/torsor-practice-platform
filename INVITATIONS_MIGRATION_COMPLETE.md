# ✅ INVITATIONS TABLE MIGRATION - COMPLETE

## **Problem Solved**

**Before:** Skill assessment data was inconsistent, with:
- ❌ `skill_assessments` table showing zeros or missing data
- ❌ Luke's portal showing "0 skills assessed" or "all oranges" (level 2)
- ❌ Admin dashboard showing "0 assessments" for the entire team
- ❌ Data integrity issues due to dual-source confusion

**After:** Single source of truth - `invitations` table
- ✅ All skill data comes from `invitations.assessment_data` JSONB
- ✅ Luke's portal will now show **real levels** (1-5 across 110 skills)
- ✅ Admin dashboard will show **all 16 team members** with correct assessments
- ✅ No more data sync issues - one authoritative source

---

## **What Changed**

### **1. Field Name Mapping (Snake Case)**

The JSONB data in `invitations.assessment_data` uses **snake_case**:
```json
{
  "skill_id": "632394ea-9513-4ecc-92ed-e71ba35d0c6a",
  "current_level": 1,
  "interest_level": 2
}
```

Updated all code to use:
- `skill_id` (not `skillId`)
- `current_level` (not `currentLevel`)
- `interest_level` (not `interestLevel`)

### **2. Skill Metadata Enrichment**

JSONB only has `skill_id`, so we now:
1. Load the `skills` table to get `name`, `category`, `description`
2. Map `skill_id` → skill metadata
3. Skip any skills not found in current skills table (outdated IDs)

### **3. Team Comparisons**

For features like "top performers" and "team average":
- Load **all team invitations** (16 records)
- Flatten their `assessment_data` arrays
- Compare across team using `email` as the stable join key

---

## **Files Modified**

### **Individual Portal Components**

#### **1. `MySkillsHeatmap.tsx`** ✅
- **Before:** Queried `skill_assessments` table
- **After:** Queries `invitations` table directly
- **Key Changes:**
  - Join on `email` (not `team_member_id`)
  - Load `skills` table for metadata
  - Use snake_case field names
  - Transform JSONB → `SkillAssessment` interface

#### **2. `TeamMemberDashboard.tsx`** ✅
- **Before:** Both `loadDashboardData()` and `loadDashboardDataForMember()` queried `skill_assessments`
- **After:** Both functions now query `invitations`
- **Key Changes:**
  - Query by `email` and `practice_id`
  - Transform JSONB into flat assessment records
  - Calculate stats from `assessment_data` length

### **Admin Dashboard Components**

#### **3. `SkillsDashboardV2Page.tsx`** ✅
- **Before:** Paginated through `skill_assessments` in 1000-row batches
- **After:** Loads all `invitations` (16 records) and flattens JSONB
- **Key Changes:**
  - No more pagination needed (16 invitations vs 1776 assessments)
  - Maps `email` → `member.id` for downstream components
  - Transforms JSONB → flat `assessment` records with snake_case

#### **4. `GapAnalysis.tsx`** ✅ (No Changes Needed)
- Pure presentation component - receives data via props
- Automatically fixed by `SkillsDashboardV2Page` migration

#### **5. `SkillsMatrix.tsx`** ✅ (No Changes Needed)
- Pure presentation component - receives data via props
- Automatically fixed by `SkillsDashboardV2Page` migration

## **Data Architecture Decision**

### **Why `invitations` Table?**

1. **Authoritative Source**: Skills assessments are captured during invitation acceptance
2. **JSONB Flexibility**: Easy to store 111 skills per member without 1776 rows
3. **Email-Based Join**: More stable than UUIDs which can drift between tables
4. **No Sync Issues**: Only one place to read/write assessment data
5. **Faster Queries**: 16 invitations vs 1776 skill_assessments rows

### **Deprecation Notice**

The `skill_assessments` table is now **deprecated** and should not be used for:
- ❌ Reading assessment data
- ❌ Writing new assessments
- ❌ Calculating team stats

It may be kept for audit/historical purposes, but the **invitations table is the single source of truth**.

See `ARCHITECTURE_DECISION.md` for full rationale.

## **Expected Behavior After Deployment**

### **Luke's Individual Portal**
- ✅ **Skills Heatmap**: Will show 110 skills with levels 1-5 (not all zeros or all oranges)
- ✅ **Team Comparison**: Top performers will be calculated from all 16 team members
- ✅ **Dashboard Stats**: "110 skills assessed" instead of "0 skills assessed"

### **Admin Dashboard (James)**
- ✅ **Skills Matrix**: All 16 members will show their actual assessments (1776 cells populated)
- ✅ **Gap Analysis**: All 3 scatter plots will show real data points
- ✅ **Team Overview**: Stats will reflect real assessment completion rates

### **Database Queries**
- **Before**: 1776 rows from `skill_assessments` (slow, paginated)
- **After**: 16 rows from `invitations` (fast, single query)

---

## **Testing Checklist**

### **✅ To Test After Deployment:**

1. **Luke's Portal** (`ltyrrell@rpgcc.co.uk`)
   - [ ] Login successful
   - [ ] Dashboard shows "110 skills assessed" (not 0)
   - [ ] Skills Heatmap shows varied colors (not all orange)
   - [ ] Clicking on heatmap squares scrolls to detailed skill view
   - [ ] Team average and top performers are calculated correctly

2. **Admin Dashboard** (`jhoward@rpgcc.co.uk`)
   - [ ] Login successful
   - [ ] Team Management → Skills shows "1776 assessments" (not 0)
   - [ ] Skills Matrix heatmap shows all 16 members with varied colors
   - [ ] Gap Analysis shows 3 populated scatter plots
   - [ ] Service lines show proper coverage (not all zeros)

3. **Performance**
   - [ ] Pages load faster (16 vs 1776 rows)
   - [ ] No "1000-row limit" warnings in console
   - [ ] No infinite loading states

## **Commits**

1. **`fix: Use snake_case field names from invitations JSONB`** (6af15de)
   - Fixed `MySkillsHeatmap` to use `current_level`, `interest_level`, `skill_id`
   - Added skills table lookup for metadata enrichment

2. **`feat: Migrate admin dashboard to use invitations table`** (348ac1f)
   - Fixed `SkillsDashboardV2Page` to query invitations
   - Fixed `TeamMemberDashboard` stats calculation
   - Removed `skill_assessments` table queries

---

## **Next Steps (If Issues Arise)**

### **If Luke's Portal Still Shows Zeros:**
1. Check browser console for error logs
2. Verify `ltyrrell@rpgcc.co.uk` exists in `invitations` with `status='accepted'`
3. Verify `assessment_data` JSONB is not empty
4. Check that skill IDs in JSONB match current `skills` table

### **If Admin Dashboard Shows Zeros:**
1. Verify all 16 team members have `email` field populated in `practice_members`
2. Check that emails match between `practice_members` and `invitations`
3. Ensure `invitations.status = 'accepted'` for all team members

### **If Performance Issues:**
1. Check Supabase query logs for slow queries
2. Verify `invitations` table has proper indexes on `email`, `practice_id`, `status`
3. Consider adding GIN index on `assessment_data` JSONB if needed

---

## **Rollback Plan** (If Needed)

If critical issues arise, you can temporarily revert to `skill_assessments`:

1. Revert commits: `git revert 348ac1f 6af15de`
2. Push: `git push origin main`
3. Railway will auto-deploy previous version

However, this will bring back the original "zeros" issue, so it's only a stopgap.

---

## **Status: ✅ READY FOR TESTING**

**Deployment:** Automatic via Railway (~2 minutes)

**Test URL:** https://torsor.co.uk/team-member

**Estimated Resolution:** This should **completely fix** the "0 skills" and "all oranges" issues.
