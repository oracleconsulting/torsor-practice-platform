# 🎉 New Features Summary - October 10, 2025

## ✅ **All Requested Features Completed**

After fixing the critical React error #310, we've successfully implemented 4 new features to enhance the TORSOR Skills Portal.

---

## 📋 **Features Implemented**

### 1. ✅ **Interest Level Now Mandatory in Assessment**

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/team-portal/PublicAssessmentPage.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added red asterisk (*) to "Interest Level" label
- ✅ Changed placeholder text to "Rate your interest (required)"
- ✅ Added validation before allowing "Next Category"
- ✅ Shows clear error toast: "Please Complete All Skills - You must rate both skill level and interest level for all X skills in this category before continuing."
- ✅ Prevents proceeding until ALL skills in category have BOTH ratings

**User Experience:**
```
Before: Users could skip interest level → incomplete data
After: Must rate both skill level AND interest level → complete, quality data ✅
```

---

### 2. ✅ **Previous Button to Go Back in Assessment**

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/team-portal/PublicAssessmentPage.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `previousCategory()` function
- ✅ Imported `ArrowLeft` icon from lucide-react
- ✅ Added "Previous" button (only shows after first category)
- ✅ Smooth scroll to top when navigating between categories
- ✅ Button styling matches design system (outline variant)

**User Experience:**
```
Before: One-way progression, can't review previous answers
After: Can go back anytime to review/change previous categories ✅
```

**Navigation Layout:**
```
Category 1: [          Next Category →          ]
Category 2: [ ← Previous ] [   Next Category →  ]
Category 3: [ ← Previous ] [   Next Category →  ]
Last Cat:   [ ← Previous ] [ Complete Assessment ]
```
