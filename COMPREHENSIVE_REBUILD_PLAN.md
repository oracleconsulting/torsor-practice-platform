# 🎯 COMPREHENSIVE REBUILD - Final Plan

## Current Status
We have a basic v2 with:
- ✅ Login/auth working
- ✅ Basic heatmap showing
- ⚠️ Skills Management (incomplete - doesn't match your UI)
- ⚠️ Service Readiness (only 5 services, should be 10)
- ❌ Team Insights (missing)
- ❌ Development Opportunities (missing)
- ❌ LLM Analysis (missing)
- ❌ Assessment correlations (missing)

## What You Actually Have (From Archive)

### 10 Service Lines:
1. Automation
2. Management Accounts
3. Future Financial Information / Advisory Accelerator
4. Benchmarking - External and Internal
5. 365 Alignment Programme
6. Systems Audit
7. Profit Extraction / Remuneration Strategies
8. Fractional CFO Services
9. Fractional COO Services
10. Combined CFO/COO Advisory

### Complete Features in Archive:
- Skills Dashboard V2 (with progressive disclosure)
- Service Readiness Dashboard (with all analytics)
- Service Line Preferences Admin (with team rankings)
- LLM Service (Perplexity integration)
- Team Insights Generation
- Assessment Analysis System
- CPD Tracking
- Mentoring Programs
- Development Opportunities

## The Right Approach

Instead of rebuilding piece by piece, I should:

1. **Copy the entire working system from archive**
2. **Adapt ONLY the database queries** to use our clean schema
3. **Keep ALL the UI/UX exactly as is**
4. **Test thoroughly**

This is a 2-3 hour systematic migration, not piecemeal rebuilding.

## Next Action

I'll create a new context window summary and continue with a systematic file-by-file copy and adaptation approach.

**Do you want me to:**
A) Continue in this context (I have ~70k tokens left)
B) Create a comprehensive handoff document for a fresh context
C) Something else?

The right answer is probably A - continue here and get as much done as possible, then hand off what's left.
