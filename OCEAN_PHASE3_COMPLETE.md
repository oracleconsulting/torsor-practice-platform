```

This creates:

- `team_member_profiles` table
- `team_compositions` table
- `team_assessment_overview` view
- `practice_team_composition_summary` view
- RLS policies
- Helper functions

### **Step 2: Add Routes to Portal**

**Team Member Portal Routes:**
```tsx
// In your router configuration
import CombinedAssessmentPage from '@/pages/accountancy/team/CombinedAssessmentPage';

// Add route:
<Route path="/team-member/assessments" element={<CombinedAssessmentPage />} />
```

**Admin Portal Routes:**
```tsx
// In your admin router
import TeamAssessmentDashboard from '@/components/accountancy/team/TeamAssessmentDashboard';
import TeamCompositionAnalyzer from '@/components/accountancy/team/TeamCompositionAnalyzer';

// Add routes:
<Route path="/admin/team/assessments" element={<TeamAssessmentDashboard practiceId={practiceId} />} />
<Route path="/admin/team/composition" element={<TeamCompositionAnalyzer practiceId={practiceId} />} />
```

### **Step 3: Add Navigation Links**

**Team Member Dashboard:**
```tsx
<Card onClick={() => navigate('/team-member/assessments')}>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <Brain className="w-5 h-5" />
      Professional Assessments
    </CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>
      Complete your VARK + OCEAN profile
    </CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    {/* Show completion status */}
    <Progress value={completionPercentage} />
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

**Admin Navigation:**
```tsx
<NavLink to="/admin/team/assessments">
  <Brain className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
  Team Assessments
</NavLink>

<NavLink to="/admin/team/composition">
