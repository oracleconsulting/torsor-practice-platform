# üö® Railway Deployment Not Triggering - Debug Guide

**Issue**: Code pushed to GitHub 3+ hours ago but Railway hasn't deployed it.

---

## üîç **Immediate Checks**

### 1. Check Railway Deployment Status
1. Go to your Railway project: https://railway.app/project/[your-project-id]
2. Look at the **Deployments** tab
3. What do you see?
   - ‚úÖ **Deployments listed**: Check if they failed or succeeded
   - ‚ùå **No recent deployments**: Auto-deploy is likely disabled

### 2. Check Auto-Deploy Setting
1. In Railway project, click on your **torsor-practice-platform** service
2. Go to **Settings** tab
3. Scroll to **Source** section
4. Look for **"Deploy on Push"** or **"Auto Deploy"**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è If it's **OFF**, that's why it's not deploying!
   - Turn it **ON**

### 3. Check GitHub Webhook
1. Go to your GitHub repo: `oracleconsulting/torsor-practice-platform`
2. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Webhooks**
3. Look for a webhook pointing to `railway.app`
   - If it exists, check its **Recent Deliveries**
   - If there are failed deliveries (red ‚ùå), that's the problem
   - If no webhook exists, Railway isn't connected

## üîß **Quick Fixes**

### Fix 1: Manual Deploy
**Fastest way to deploy NOW:**
1. Go to Railway ‚Üí Your Service ‚Üí **Deployments** tab
2. Click **"Deploy"** ‚Üí **"From Branch"**
3. Select **main** branch
4. Click **Deploy**
‚è±Ô∏è **ETA**: 5-10 minutes

### Fix 2: Re-enable Auto-Deploy
1. Railway ‚Üí Service ‚Üí **Settings**
2. Find **"Deploy on Push"**
3. Toggle it **ON**
4. Make a small commit to test:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/James.Howard/Documents/OracleConsultingAI/torsor-practice-platform
   echo "# Test" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "test: Trigger Railway auto-deploy"
   git push origin main
   ```
5. Watch Railway for a new deployment

### Fix 3: Reconnect GitHub
If webhooks are broken:
1. Railway ‚Üí Service ‚Üí **Settings**
2. Scroll to **Source**
3. Click **"Disconnect"** (if connected)
4. Click **"Connect Repository"**
5. Re-authorize and select your repo
6. This will recreate the webhook

## üß™ **Test if It's Working**

After fixing, verify with a dummy commit:
```bash
cd /Users/James.Howard/Documents/OracleConsultingAI/torsor-practice-platform
git commit --allow-empty -m "test: Verify Railway auto-deploy"
git push origin main
```

Then check Railway Deployments tab - you should see a new deployment start within 30 seconds.

## üìä **Current Status**

- **Last Successful Push**: 19:50 (3 hours ago)
- **Expected Deployment Time**: 5-10 minutes
- **Actual Status at 22:22**: NOT DEPLOYED ‚ùå
- **Workaround Applied**: Team Metrics tab disabled temporarily

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

1. **The fix for React error #310 IS in the code** (comparePeriods prop removed)
2. **Railway just hasn't deployed it yet**
3. **Workaround deployed**: Team Metrics tab now hidden to unblock you
4. **Once Railway deploys**, the tab can be re-enabled

---

## üéØ **Action Required**

**Please check Railway now:**
1. Is auto-deploy enabled?
2. Are there any failed deployments?
3. Try a manual deploy to get the latest code live ASAP

Once you have the latest deployment live (either the comparePeriods fix OR the workaround), the site will work properly!
