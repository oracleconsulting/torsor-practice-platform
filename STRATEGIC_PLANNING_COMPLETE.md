- 📈 **Desired involvement %** (0-100%)
- 📝 **Notes field** for context
- 🎨 **Color-coded priority** (Green: Top 2, Blue: 3-5, Gray: 6-8)
- 💾 **Auto-save** with success notifications
- 📱 **Fully responsive** design

**Service Lines**:
1. 🔄 Automation
2. 📊 Management Accounts
3. 💼 Advisory/Forecasting
4. 🎯 365 Alignment
5. 🔍 Systems Audit
6. 🔐 Client Vault
7. ✅ Compliance
8. ⭐ Core Capability

**User Experience**:
```
1. Drag service lines to reorder by interest
2. Set experience level (0-5 scale with visual dots)
3. Choose desired time commitment (% slider)
4. Add notes about interests/experience
5. Click "Save Preferences"

```

### 2. **VARK Learning Style Assessment** ✅
**Location**: CPD Page → "Learning Style" Tab

**Features**:
- 🧠 **16 standard VARK questions**
- 📊 **Results dashboard** with learning style profile
- 🎯 **V/A/R/K/M scoring** (Visual/Auditory/Reading/Kinesthetic/Multimodal)
- 💡 **Personalized recommendations**
- 🔄 **Retake option** available
- 💾 **Saved to database** for future reference

**Learning Styles Detected**:
- 🔵 **Visual** (V) - Charts, diagrams, videos
- 🟣 **Auditory** (A) - Discussions, lectures, podcasts
- 🟢 **Reading/Writing** (R) - Documents, notes, written materials
- 🟠 **Kinesthetic** (K) - Hands-on, practical, doing
- 🌸 **Multimodal** (M) - Mix of multiple styles

**Integration**:
- Used in CPD recommendations
- Matched to service line requirements
- Informs training delivery methods

### 3. **Strategic Matching Algorithm** ✅
**Location**: API Layer (`strategic-matching.ts`)

**Scoring System**:
```
Match Score = 
  Interest Score (35%)        // Lower rank = higher score
  + Skill Score (30%)         // Avg skill level in service line
  + Experience Score (20%)    // Current experience level
  + Capacity Score (10%)      // Availability (100 - utilization%)
  + Learning Style Fit (5%)   // VARK alignment bonus
```

**Key Functions**:

1. **`calculateMatchScore()`**
   - Multi-factor scoring (0-100)
   - Readiness assessment
   - Development needs identification
   - Match breakdown details

2. **`generateServiceLineDeploymentPlan()`**
   - Current team analysis
   - Recommended additions
   - Skill gap identification
   - Training priorities

3. **`findBestCandidatesForServiceLine()`**
   - Quick deployment recommendations
   - Top N candidates by match score
   - Immediate vs. future deployment

4. **`generateComprehensiveDeploymentPlan()`**
   - Firm-wide optimization
   - Priority-based allocation
   - Resource balancing

**Readiness Levels**:
- **Immediate**: 75%+ skill+experience score → Deploy now
- **Short-term**: 50-74% → Deploy within 1-3 months with light training
- **Medium-term**: 25-49% → 3-6 months development needed
- **Long-term**: <25% → 6+ months training required

## 📊 How It Works: End-to-End

### For Team Members:
1. **Complete Skills Assessment** (111 skills)
2. **Rank Service Line Interests** (drag-and-drop)
3. **Set Experience Levels** (0-5 per service line)
4. **Choose Desired Involvement** (% of time)
5. **Take VARK Assessment** (learning style)
6. **Generate CPD Recommendations** (skill-specific)

### For Management:
1. **View Service Line Coverage** (`service_line_coverage` view)
2. **Run Strategic Matching** (algorithm calculates scores)
3. **See Deployment Recommendations**:
   - Current team: Match score 70%+
   - Potential additions: Match score 60-69%
   - Training needed: <60% but high interest
4. **Identify Skill Gaps** (by service line)
5. **Plan Training** (targeted CPD for high-potential members)

### Example Output:
```
Service Line: Advisory/Forecasting
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Current Team (Immediate Deployment):
1. Sarah O'Reilly - Match: 87%
   ├ Interest: Rank #2 (90%)

Recommended Additions (With Training):
3. James Howard - Match: 65%
   ├ Interest: Rank #4 (65%)
   ├ Skills: 3.1/5 avg (62%)
   └ Training: Focus on forecasting models (20hrs)

Skill Gaps:
- Cash Flow Forecasting: 2.3/5 → 4/5 (Gap: 1.7)
- Scenario Modelling: 1.8/5 → 4/5 (Gap: 2.2)
- Business Valuations: 2.1/5 → 3/5 (Gap: 0.9)

Training Priority:
1. Luke Tyrrell → Forecasting + Modelling (30hrs)
