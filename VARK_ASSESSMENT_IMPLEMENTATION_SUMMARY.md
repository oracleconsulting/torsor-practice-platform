## Technical Features

### Auto-Save Functionality
- Answers saved to localStorage after each selection
- Key format: `vark_answers_{teamMemberId}`
- Prevents data loss if browser closes
- Cleared after successful submission

### Score Calculation
```typescript
Score = (Count of style selections / Total questions) Ã— 100
```

### Multimodal Detection
A user is considered multimodal if:
- 2+ learning styles have scores within 10% of the highest score
- Example: Visual 40%, Auditory 38%, Reading 15%, Kinesthetic 7%
  - Result: Multimodal (Visual + Auditory)

### Recommendations Engine
Dynamically generates personalized recommendations based on:
- Primary learning style
- Secondary styles (if multimodal)
- Score distribution
- Context (CPD, skills development, team training)

---

## Usage Examples

### Self-Assessment
```typescript
// Navigate to assessment
navigate('/accountancy/team-portal/vark-assessment');

// Component auto-detects current user
<VARKAssessment
  teamMemberId={user.id}
  onComplete={() => navigate('/accountancy/team')}
/>
```

### Admin Assessing Team Member
```typescript
// Navigate with query params
navigate(
  `/accountancy/team-portal/vark-assessment?member_id=${memberId}&member_name=${memberName}`
);
```

### Displaying Learning Style Badge
```typescript
// In any component with team member data
{getLearningStyleBadge(member.learningStyle)}
```

### Fetching Team Learning Styles
```typescript
import { getTeamLearningStyles } from '@/lib/api/learning-preferences';

const { members, distribution, completion_rate } = 
  await getTeamLearningStyles(practiceId);

console.log(`Team completion rate: ${completion_rate}%`);
console.log('Distribution:', distribution);
// { visual: 3, auditory: 2, reading_writing: 1, kinesthetic: 2, multimodal: 1 }
```

## Database Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Migration
```bash
# Using your database client
psql -d your_database -f oracle-method-portal/database/migrations/20251012_vark_assessment.sql
```

### 2. Verify Tables Created
```sql
-- Check tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name IN ('learning_preferences', 'vark_questions');

-- Verify questions loaded
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vark_questions;
-- Should return: 16
```

### 3. Grant Permissions (if needed)
```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON learning_preferences TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON vark_questions TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON team_learning_styles_overview TO authenticated;
```

## API Endpoints (Backend Integration)

If you're implementing backend endpoints, consider these:

```typescript
// Suggested endpoints
GET    /api/vark/questions              // Get all questions
GET    /api/vark/preferences/:memberId  // Get member's results
POST   /api/vark/preferences             // Save assessment
PUT    /api/vark/preferences/:memberId  // Update assessment
