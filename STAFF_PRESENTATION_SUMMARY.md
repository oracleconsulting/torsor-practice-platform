## The Challenge We're Solving

### Before the Skills Matrix:
- ❌ **No visibility** into who has what skills across the firm
- ❌ **Guesswork** when assigning team members to projects
- ❌ **Reactive training** - addressing skill gaps after they become problems
- ❌ **Unstructured mentoring** - difficult to match mentors with mentees
- ❌ **Individual silos** - team members don't know who to ask for help
- ❌ **CPD tracking** on spreadsheets and paper
- ❌ **Service line planning** based on assumptions, not data

## FAQs

**Q: Will this affect my performance review?**
A: No. The Skills Matrix is for development and planning, not performance management. Your self-assessments won't be used in appraisals.

**Q: What if I rate myself lower than I should?**
A: That's fine! The system is designed for honest self-assessment. Lower ratings help us provide you with the right training and support.

**Q: What if I don't have time?**
A: The initial assessment takes 60-90 minutes (one-time). Ongoing use is minimal (5-10 min/month). The time you save finding experts and getting relevant training far outweighs the input required.

**Q: Can I update my assessment later?**
A: Absolutely! Your skills grow, and the matrix should reflect that. Update anytime you learn something new.

**Q: Will partners see my low scores?**
A: Partners see aggregated firm data, not individual scores. Your manager may see your skills to help with development planning, but the focus is on growth, not judgment.

**Q: What about skills I have that aren't listed?**
A: Contact the admin team to add new skills. The matrix is designed to grow with our services.
