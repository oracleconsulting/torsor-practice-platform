# Quick Fix for Team Assessment Dashboard Crashes

## Issue
The "Team Composition" and "Insights" tabs in the Team Assessment page are causing React error #62 due to chart rendering issues.

## Temporary Solution
These tabs have been temporarily disabled to prevent crashes. The data is still available in the new **ASSESSMENT INSIGHTS** dashboard in the Admin Portal.

## Where to Find the New Dashboard

### For Assessment Insights:
1. Navigate to **Admin Portal** / **Team Management Hub**
2. Click the **"ASSESSMENT INSIGHTS"** tab (should be the last tab)
3. This provides comprehensive team insights with working charts

### Current Team Assessment Page:
- "Team List" tab: ✅ Working (shows completion status)
- "Team Composition" tab: ⚠️ Temporarily disabled
- "Insights" tab: ⚠️ Temporarily disabled

## Next Steps
- Use the Admin Portal's "ASSESSMENT INSIGHTS" for strategic team analysis
- The Team List tab still shows who's completed which assessments
- Chart issues will be resolved in next update

## Navigation Path
```
Dashboard → Team Management (Admin) → ASSESSMENT INSIGHTS
```

This comprehensive dashboard includes:
- Team Health Score
- Assessment completion tracking
- Team composition analysis
- Team dynamics metrics
- Development gaps
- Strategic recommendations
