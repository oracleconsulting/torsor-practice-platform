# 🎉 Email Debug Session - COMPLETE

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **ROOT CAUSE FOUND - FIX READY**

---

## 🔍 **What We Found**

### **The Good News ✅**

1. **Your Resend API key is VALID and WORKING**
   - Key: `re_gNeRqnEt_MxFb413pA2FZKFsCLD1XeBGC`
   - Successfully sent test email
   - Message ID: `a7766f9c-3c7b-4e22-ac3a-2fded2866d2f`

2. **Resend is configured correctly**
   - API responding properly
   - Email delivery working
   - Account active

3. **Invitation system is working**
   - Database saves invitations ✅
   - Invitation links generate ✅
   - Delete functionality works ✅

### **The Issues ❌**

1. **Frontend can't access API key**
   - Railway has: `RESEND_API_KEY`
   - Frontend needs: `VITE_RESEND_API_KEY` (with prefix)
   - Result: Email service thinks it's not configured

2. **Resend in test mode**
   - Can ONLY send to: `jameshowardivc@gmail.com`
   - Cannot send to team members yet
   - Need to verify domain for production use

---

## 🎯 **The Fix**

### **Immediate (5 minutes) - Test Mode:**

Add these 3 variables to Railway:

```bash
VITE_RESEND_API_KEY=re_gNeRqnEt_MxFb413pA2FZKFsCLD1XeBGC
VITE_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev
VITE_FROM_NAME=RPGCC Team Portal
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Email service detects API key
- ✅ Can send invitations to `jameshowardivc@gmail.com`
- ✅ Test entire invitation flow
- ⏳ Cannot send to team yet (domain not verified)

### **Production (30 minutes) - Full Launch:**

1. **Verify domain in Resend:**
   - Go to: https://resend.com/domains
   - Add: `rpgcc.co.uk`
   - Add DNS records (Resend shows which ones)
   - Wait ~15 min for verification

2. **Update Railway variable:**
   ```bash
   VITE_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@rpgcc.co.uk
   ```

**Result:**
- ✅ Can send to ANY email address
- ✅ Professional sender email
- ✅ Ready for team launch
- ✅ No restrictions

---

## 📊 **Evidence**

### **Curl Test Results:**

**Test 1: Wrong recipient (not account owner)**
```bash
curl test to: laspartnership@googlemail.com
Response: 403 Forbidden - "You can only send testing emails to your own email address"
```

**Test 2: Correct recipient (account owner)**
```bash
curl test to: jameshowardivc@gmail.com
Response: {"id":"a7766f9c-3c7b-4e22-ac3a-2fded2866d2f"}
Status: SUCCESS ✅
```

### **Code Analysis:**

**File:** `src/lib/email-service.ts` (Line 10)
```javascript
const RESEND_API_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_RESEND_API_KEY;
```

**Problem:** `import.meta.env.VITE_RESEND_API_KEY` returns `undefined`

**Why:** Vite only exposes environment variables with `VITE_` prefix to frontend

**Solution:** Add `VITE_RESEND_API_KEY` to Railway
