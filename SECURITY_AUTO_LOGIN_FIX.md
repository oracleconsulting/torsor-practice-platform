# Auto-Login Security Fix

## Problem
The platform was automatically logging users in as `james@ivcaccounting.co.uk` after sign out or page refresh, bypassing all authentication.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Aggressive Bypass in ProtectedRoutes (CRITICAL - FIXED ✅)
**Location**: `src/components/ProtectedRoutes.tsx` (lines 60-62)

**What it was**:
```typescript
// AGGRESSIVE EMERGENCY BYPASS - Always allow access
console.log('[ProtectedRoute] Using aggressive bypass - allowing access');
return <>{children</>;
```

**Problem**: This bypassed ALL authentication checks, allowing anyone to access any protected route without credentials.

**Fix**: Removed the aggressive bypass. Now properly checks for authenticated user.

### 2. Mock Practice Fallback (CRITICAL - FIXED ✅)
**Location**: `src/contexts/AccountancyContext.tsx` (lines 231-251)

**What it was**:
```typescript
const mockPractice: Practice = {
  id: '6d0a4f47-1a98-4bba-be4e-26c439b1358d',
  name: 'IVC Accounting - Demo',
  email: 'james@ivcaccounting.co.uk',  // ❌ Hardcoded
  contactName: 'James Howard',
  ...
};
```

**Problem**: On any error, system would create a fake practice with hardcoded credentials, effectively auto-logging in as James.

**Fix**: Removed mock practice fallback. Now requires real authentication and real practice data.

## Remaining References (SAFE ✓)

These references to `james@ivcaccounting.co.uk` are **NOT** causing auto-login and are safe:

### 1. UI Display Fallbacks
**Locations**: 
- `src/components/accountancy/layout/AccountancyLayout.tsx` (line 395)
- `src/components/layout/AccountancyLayout.tsx` (line 342)

```typescript
<p className="text-xs text-secondary">{user?.email || 'james@ivcaccounting.co.uk'}</p>
```

**Purpose**: Display fallback for UI only. Does NOT authenticate or grant access.
**Safe**: ✓ Visual only, no security impact

### 2. Admin Role Checks
**Locations**:
- `src/services/adminService.ts` (line 122)
- `src/components/layout/DynamicHeader.tsx` (line 45)

```typescript
const isAdmin = (email: string) => email === 'james@ivcaccounting.co.uk';
```

**Purpose**: Role-based access control - checks if authenticated user is admin.
**Safe**: ✓ Only checks already-authenticated users

### 3. Test Files
**Location**: `src/tests/auth/roles.test.ts`

**Purpose**: Unit tests for authentication flows
**Safe**: ✓ Test code, not production

### 4. Admin Initialization
**Location**: `src/services/initializeAdminService.ts` (line 54)

**Purpose**: Creates super admin account on first setup
**Safe**: ✓ Setup utility, requires actual authentication to use

### 5. Oracle Dashboard Features
**Location**: `src/pages/OracleDashboard.tsx`

**Purpose**: Feature flags for IVC-specific functionality
**Safe**: ✓ Only affects UI features, not authentication

## What Changed

### Before (Insecure ❌)
1. Any user could access protected routes without authentication
2. On error, system would auto-create fake credentials
3. Sign out didn't work - aggressive bypass re-authenticated
4. Refresh would bypass authentication

### After (Secure ✅)
1. All protected routes require real authentication
2. Errors do NOT create fake credentials
3. Sign out properly signs out
4. Refresh maintains session OR requires re-login (as expected)

## Testing

### Required Tests Before Deployment:

1. **Sign Out Test**
   - [ ] Sign in with valid credentials
   - [ ] Click sign out
   - [ ] Verify you're redirected to login page
   - [ ] Verify you CANNOT access protected pages
   - [ ] Verify no auto-login occurs

2. **Refresh Test**
   - [ ] Sign in with valid credentials
   - [ ] Refresh the page
   - [ ] Either: Session maintained (logged in) OR redirected to login
   - [ ] But NEVER auto-login as different user

3. **Multiple Users Test**
   - [ ] Sign in as User A
   - [ ] Note which practice/email is shown
   - [ ] Sign out
   - [ ] Sign in as User B
   - [ ] Verify User B sees their own data, NOT User A's

4. **Direct URL Access Test**
   - [ ] Sign out completely
   - [ ] Try accessing: `/team-member/dashboard`
   - [ ] Should redirect to login
   - [ ] Should NOT show any content without authentication

## Emergency Bypass (Still Available)

The emergency bypass is still available for development/debugging but is NOT active by default:

```typescript
// In browser console:
localStorage.setItem('oracle-auth-token', 'temp-admin-bypass');
// Then refresh page
```

**To remove emergency bypass**:
```typescript
localStorage.removeItem('oracle-auth-token');
```

## Production Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to all team members:

- [x] Remove aggressive bypass from ProtectedRoutes
- [x] Remove mock practice fallback from AccountancyContext
- [ ] Test sign out functionality
- [ ] Test refresh behavior
- [ ] Test with multiple different users
- [ ] Test direct URL access without auth
- [ ] Verify no console errors during auth flows
- [ ] Test on different browsers
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Clear all test/demo accounts from production database

## Support

If users report auto-login issues:
1. Check browser console for `[ProtectedRoute]` and `[Auth]` logs
2. Verify `localStorage.getItem('oracle-auth-token')` is not set
3. Clear browser cache and localStorage
4. Try in incognito/private mode
5. Check if user has valid credentials in database
