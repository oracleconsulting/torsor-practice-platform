# Skills Heatmap - "Not Assessed" Explanation

## Why Many Skills Show as "Not Assessed"

The gray dashes ("-") you're seeing are **correct** and represent genuine gaps in assessment data.

## What Changed

### Before (with 12 phantom skills):
- **123 total skills** (111 real + 12 phantom)
- Everyone appeared to have ~10% lower coverage
- Service readiness calculations were artificially deflated

### After (fixed):
- **111 active skills** (only skills with historical assessment data)
- True coverage percentages shown
- Service readiness based on real capabilities

## The Reality

**This is showing you the truth:** Many team members have not completed all 111 skills assessments.

### To Improve Coverage:

1. **High Priority** (get to 100%):
   - Luke Tyrrell: 1 skill remaining
   - Edward Gale: 12 skills remaining
   - Jaanu Anandeswaran: 30 skills remaining

2. **Medium Priority** (significant gaps):
   - Tanya, Wes, James, MEdirisinghe, Lynley, Jack, Rizwan, Lambros

3. **Critical** (need complete reassessment):
   - Azalia Farman: Only 21/111 assessed (19%)
   - Shari Baird-Caesar: Only 5/111 assessed (5%)

## New Heatmap Design

✅ **Team members on left** (sticky column)  
✅ **Horizontal scrolling** for all skills  
✅ **Full skill names** visible (no more rotated text)  
✅ **Larger badges** (12x12) for better readability  
✅ **Alternating row colors** for easier scanning  
✅ **Grouped by category** for logical organization

**The "not assessed" entries are not a bug - they're accurate data showing who needs to complete their skills assessments.**
