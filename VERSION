v1.0.5-remove-teammetrics-import-2025-10-10-23:00
Build: Remove TeamMetrics IMPORT statement (not just JSX)
Fix: React error #310 - The import was loading the broken module
Previous: v1.0.4 disabled JSX but kept import (error persisted)
Current: Removed import statement completely
Data: Database cleaned - 2 real members (Luke + Jaanu)
Expected: Advisory Skills page loads WITHOUT errors
