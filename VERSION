v1.0.9-data-flow-debug-2025-10-10-23:45

🔍 DATA FLOW INVESTIGATION IN PROGRESS

## Changes in v1.0.9:

### Debugging Added
- ✅ Comprehensive console logging in AdvisorySkillsPage.tsx
- ✅ Fallback query for practice_members if join fails
- ✅ Detailed member construction logging
- ✅ Error tracking at each step

### What We're Investigating
- ❌ Skills Matrix: No data showing despite 111 skills loaded
- ❌ Gap Analysis: Visualization unclear
- ❌ Development Planning: Team members missing  
- ❌ Skills Analysis: No skills displayed
- **Root Issue**: 0 team members found (expected: Luke + Jaanu)

### Debug Output Expected
- 🔍 Fetching skill assessments...
- 📊 Assessments query result: { count, error, sampleData }
- 👥 Unique team member IDs: [...]
- 📋 Practice members: { count, error, members }
- 👤 Building member: { memberId, name, role, hasData }

### Possible Root Causes
1. Assessments in `survey_sessions` not `skill_assessments`
2. Foreign key relationship misconfigured
3. RLS policy blocking access
4. Table structure mismatch

### Next Steps
1. Refresh page after deployment
2. Check console for new debug logs
3. Identify exact failure point
4. Apply targeted fix
