v1.0.6-isolate-problem-component-2025-10-10-23:10
Build: Disable ALL component imports except SkillsMatrix to isolate the problem
Status: React error #310 persisted even after removing TeamMetrics import
Test: Only SkillsMatrix and Skills Analysis tabs enabled
Goal: Identify which component is causing the hook error
Previous: v1.0.5 removed TeamMetrics import (error persisted)
Current: Minimal configuration - if this works, we add components back one by one
Data: Database cleaned - 2 real members (Luke + Jaanu)
