v1.1.0-data-migration-fix-2025-10-11-00:00

✅ MAJOR DATA FLOW FIX DEPLOYED!

## Changes in v1.1.0:

### Critical Fix: Data Migration
- ✅ Created migration: `20251011_migrate_survey_to_assessments.sql`
- ✅ Migrates assessment data from `survey_sessions.survey_data` to `skill_assessments`
- ✅ Creates `practice_members` records if missing
- ✅ Links all assessments to correct team members
- ✅ Handles both camelCase and snake_case field names
- ✅ Preserves all data: levels, interest, experience, notes

### Root Cause
- Public assessment submissions saved to `survey_sessions` (temp storage)
- Advisory Skills page queried `skill_assessments` (permanent storage)
- Result: 0 assessments found → "No team members found"

### Expected Results After Migration
- ✅ 222 skill assessments (Luke + Jaanu × 111 skills)
- ✅ 2 team members visible
- ✅ Skills Matrix shows heatmap
- ✅ Gap Analysis shows data points
- ✅ Development Planning shows members
- ✅ Skills Analysis populates

### Documentation Added
- `DATA_FLOW_INVESTIGATION.md` - Complete root cause analysis
- `DATA_FLOW_FIX_APPLIED.md` - Solution and verification steps
- `CHECK_ASSESSMENT_DATA.sql` - Diagnostic queries

### Next Steps
Once data loads correctly:
1. Fix Skills Matrix scrolling and layout
2. Improve Gap Analysis visualization  
3. Enable Development Planning features
4. Populate Skills Analysis accordion
5. Add UI/UX enhancements
