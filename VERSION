v1.1.1-invitation-data-migration-2025-10-11-00:15

ðŸŽ¯ CORRECT DATA SOURCE IDENTIFIED & MIGRATING!

## Changes in v1.1.1:

### Critical Fix: Correct Data Migration
- âœ… Found assessment data in `invitations.assessment_data` (not `survey_sessions`)
- âœ… Created migration: `20251011_migrate_invitation_assessments.sql`
- âœ… Migrating ALL 3 completed assessments:
  - James Howard: 111 skills
  - Luke Tyrrell: 111 skills
  - Jaanu Anandeswaran: 111 skills
- âœ… Total: ~333 skill assessments

### How We Found It
- User provided SQL export showing data in `invitations.assessment_data`
- Data is JSONB array with current_level + interest_level for each skill
- Previous migration looked in wrong table (`survey_sessions`)

### Expected Results After Migration
- âœ… Skills Matrix: Shows 3 members with colored heatmap
- âœ… Gap Analysis: Displays scatter plot with priority skills
- âœ… Development Planning: Member dropdown populated
- âœ… Skills Analysis: Categories show skill counts
- âœ… Team Metrics: Real data calculations

### Data Flow
```
invitations.assessment_data (JSONB)
  â†“ MIGRATION â†“
skill_assessments (normalized table)
  â”œâ”€ team_member_id â†’ practice_members
  â”œâ”€ skill_id â†’ skills
  â”œâ”€ current_level (0-5)
  â”œâ”€ interest_level (0-5)
  â””â”€ assessed_at (timestamp)
```

### Documentation Added
- `FINAL_DATA_MIGRATION.md` - Complete solution and verification steps
- `check-data.mjs`, `run-check.mjs`, `check-data-direct.sql` - Diagnostic scripts

### Verification Steps
1. Wait 60 seconds for GitHub Actions
2. Hard refresh Advisory Skills page (âŒ˜+Shift+R)
3. Check console for `count: 333`
4. Visual: See 3 member columns with colored cells
