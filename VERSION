v1.0.7-REAL-FIX-hooks-must-be-at-top-2025-10-10-23:25

üéØ REAL ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED!

## The Problem:
React error #310: "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render"

## Root Cause:
Line 616: `const [showManageTeam, setShowManageTeam] = useState(false);`

This hook was declared AFTER the early return statement:
```typescript
if (loading) {
  return (...); // Early return when loading
}

const [showManageTeam, setShowManageTeam] = useState(false); // ‚ùå CONDITIONAL!
```

## Why This Broke React:
- When `loading = true`: Hook was NOT called (early return)
- When `loading = false`: Hook WAS called
- React requires ALL hooks to be called in the SAME ORDER every render
- Changing the number of hooks between renders = React error #310

## The Fix:
Moved `showManageTeam` useState to the TOP of the component with all other hooks (line 134)

Now ALL hooks are called BEFORE any conditional logic or early returns.

## What Wasn't the Problem:
- ‚ùå TeamMetrics component (was fine all along)
- ‚ùå SkillsAssessment component (was fine)
- ‚ùå GapAnalysis component (was fine)
- ‚ùå DevelopmentPlanning component (was fine)
- ‚úÖ Just ONE misplaced hook in AdvisorySkillsPage!

## Re-Enabled:
- ‚úÖ ALL component imports restored
- ‚úÖ ALL tabs restored (Matrix, Assessment, Gaps, Planning, Skills Analysis, Metrics)
- ‚úÖ Full functionality restored

## Timeline:
- v1.0.4-1.0.6: Tried removing components (wrong diagnosis)
- v1.0.6: Isolated to minimal config (proved it wasn't the components)
- v1.0.7: Found the REAL cause (misplaced hook)

Data: Database cleaned - 2 real members (Luke + Jaanu)
Expected: Advisory Skills page loads perfectly with ALL tabs working!
